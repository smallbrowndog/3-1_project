0,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fit great I'm a XL..I got a L to wear under t shirts for working out. ..  love them
1,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Perfect under scrubs I‚Äôve bought these before in white or black. I decided to try the three pack of pink, lavender, and green. The pink is more of an orchid shade, which I actually like, because I wear light gray scrubs at work, and this color looks really good with the gray.<br />These tops are lightweight and snug fitting, if you order a size down. The sleeves hit me at the wrist, not too short and not too long. The length in the body is long enough to stay tucked in. I wear a medium in regular tops, and I order a small in these because I want that tight fit for layering."
2,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Basic hoodie I've bought two of these tie-die hoodies now. An extra large which was a bit bigger than expected with quite long sleeves and a large that was long and narrow. The material is thin but a close knit so I was suitable warm in Ohio's winter. The colors are vibrant and didn't bleed when washed. I like this hoodie, it matches everything!"
3,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Order a size down if you want more compression. Comfortable but not a corset. Wouldn‚Äôt buy if you‚Äôre looking for maximum compression. Order a size down for more compression.
4,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,It fits Super comfy üíï
5,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Very comfortable I have worn the three shirts and they were amazing. I wore one shirt under a thin dress blouse and it was very comfortable.I have worn the other two with jeans.  I will order another set so I will,have  one for each day.  I did order an extra large because it was form fitting.  I initially ordered the shirts for compression,but I am pleased even though they are not as compressed as I wanted them to be."
6,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Super soft and comfortably over-sized. Used for a jack frost costume and it worked perfectly
7,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Great fit,  exactly as described The dress was as described, very nice fit!"
8,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love these! These are GREAT tank tops.  I am 5'2&#34; / 120 pounds and I ordered size Medium.  They fit perfectly.  They are really lightweight and great fabric for sweating it out at the gym.  I would recommend these tank tops to anyone!
9,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Right fit Nice fit
10,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,I want it in every color! Absolutely obsessed and I want This in every color. So flattering and so comfy! It can get a little short around the ankles sometimes but I love these so much
11,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Excellent- Great Price Comfy and fit true to size
12,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Short sleeves Fits really nice on the body, great material, super flattering, BUT if you have long arms, the sleeves do run short. :("
13,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Accurate sizing Comfortable and perfect fit. I wear under my scrubs tops
14,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Best Hoodies On Amazon! I have 3 of these already and want to get these get these in every color!  The price, shipping speed, responsive customer service, the way they wash well & don‚Äôt pill/shrink & how soft they feel, I really couldn‚Äôt ask for a better hoodie situation!  The color selection for Spring is great! I‚Äôm a 5 foot female  & ordered a men‚Äôs large for that oversized cozy cover your butt & hips look.  It falls right on my upper thigh which is perfect."
15,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Well made, great buy at this price For the price, you definitely get your moneys worth. If your in between sizes, choose the larger of the two."
16,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Perfect for Spartan races I wanted some inexpensive tanks that wouldn't retain water for my Spartan races. I wore pink for my beast and blue for the sprint. I usually wear small in women's tanks but sized up to medium so they wouldn't be painted on and show every bit of mid section fluff I may have. Medium fit perfect, not baggy but not painted on, nicely fitted. They're not as soft as my good tech tops from Born Primitive, but perfect for getting wet, muddy and if it gets snagged on the barbed wire, you don't care. The mud washed out and they're good as new. Recommend for this application. I like my higher end/fancier open backed stuff for routine workouts."
17,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Quality of shirt, very good Well worth the money, feels great"
18,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great fit not hot Love these great fit and don't make me hot
19,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great as usual
20,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great material Fits just a tad bit small but not by much
21,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Love it Fits perfectly for a 2XL, even got asked where did I buy it from. I already ordered more üòÅ"
22,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice Shirt, Nice Price Great stretchy fit. Perfect length, Dries quickly. I would definitely buy again"
23,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Excellent under shirt for winter. Will definitely purchase more.
24,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great product I love these tanks. They were true to size, have a nice feel to them, and were a great price. I would buy these again."
25,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,My go to workout top This is my go to gym top since it matches any pair of leggings that I have to work out in. I love this style of tops for the gym and would definitely buy again in different colors
26,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"great I am 6'3 and about 155 lbs, so its always a struggle to find clothes that fit well. I bought the SMALLS because I wanted them to fit snugger on me than on the model in the pic, and I thought they looked long enough on the model in the pic to where a SMALL would still fit me.<br /><br />Turns out, I was correct. They fit me well. The back of the shirts are slightly longer than the front (just a note). I like that they fit me in a more form fitting (but not tight or anything) way.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these shirts are kind of mesh-like, although I don't think anything is too visible through them.<br /><br />The material is not made of cotton so they will not shrink in the washer, etc.<br /><br />I bought the triple black pack, would buy again."
27,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great fit and comfortable size fits well These are a great fit and they really are comfortable fitting. Only suggestion I would make is it is too tight around some areas and exposing a bit.
28,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I love the fabric I almost returned this without trying it on at first. I love the fabric, so I decided to give it a go and fell in love with it. I do have to buy a bandeau bra, though. Otherwise, it's far to revealing. It hides my postpartum belly well and is flattering."
29,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,as advertised! The negative reviews had me doubtful but these fit as expected and are very flattering! They were perfect for my hiit run and they are squat proof! I will be ordering more.
30,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Perfect Exactly what I was looking for! My daughters wear them under their practice/game jerseys for soccer.
31,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweatshirt Wear daily during fall/winter. Good stuff
32,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great value Really like them great value.
33,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Functional and stylish Love these shirts. Breathable (I used them for motorcycle racing),  not too thick, super soft, durable, and the stitching is slimming."
34,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great fit. Had to purchase this for my husband since he kept using mine to go outside when it was cool at night. He loves it!
35,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,These are flattering and comfortable! I asked someone wearing these where they got them and am I glad that I did. They hold my phone and look cute on without being skin tight.  Very nice for traveling since they don't look like jeans or yoga pants. I'm delighted with them and just ordered another color.
36,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Recommend Super cute and comfortable dress. Usually wear size 6 and the small fit perfectly.
37,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars fits well
38,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"I like the dress alote. I did receive my dress, I like it alote and Iam keeping it.  I know owe you for the refund you gave back to me. Thank you."
39,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Warm, Comfy, Durable and Fits Well I'm a fan of Russell clothing. It's relatively cheap, fits as expected and is durable. Their hoodies are no exception. I ordered an XXL in black heather, and it fits perfectly as a sweatshirt should. I'm borderline XL/XXL but the larger size allows for layering. The fleece is warm and the hood covers well. Overall, they're a great brand, and I highly recommend."
40,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great fit My daddy has a beer belly so I ordered a size up. It fits perfectly and he's constantly raving about how warm it is!
41,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"looks great. Exactly what I wanted.  Generously sized, well sewn, medium weight, looks great."
42,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Perfect for my needs! I bought this so I could make alterations to it to create a Martha May Whovier dress for Halloween. True to size and flattering! I bought a large so I could cut it and wear a petticoat underneath. If I wore it as intended I would have bought a medium.
43,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Fit me very well Color, size and elastic, love them."
44,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Don't expect high quality Came a little large and baggy but tight around the neck and hands. I just needed a black sweater, and didn't care much about the quality. But I can tell you right now, what you pay for is what you get. The quality on this thing is not good at all so be prepared for about two months worth of sweater."
45,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Everything was good
46,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Happy With These Shirts - Good Value; Good Fit If you are a wearer of undershirts, but looking for a little bit more compression to make you look smother....this pack of 3 shirts is for you.  I ordered shirts in my usual size and they fit nicely; not too much compression, just holding &#34;things&#34; in a little nicer.  I have been very happy with these shirts - I hope any buyer will be happy too."
47,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Good but not seamless Fits nice and I use them frequently....but I wish  they were seamless
48,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great for working out These shirts are great for the gym. Bright colors
49,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Worth the money Loose fitting and comfortable. Perfect for workouts!
50,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good Gym Tanks I'm 5'7"" 170lbs (medium-build) and went with a small. I like the fit, the material, and these are well-made. Great price too."
51,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Size up from your regular size Got an XL , usually wear L, tank form fitting around chest area and shows off what you‚Äôve been working ‚Äúback‚Äù there as well as it is loose around the stomach area which is nice when it doesn‚Äôt hug you so much there."
52,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good fit Looks great
53,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Worth it Fit just right and comfy will buy more
54,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Durable and comfortable I like the feel of this shirt. The cut is just right at the shoulders and allows for wing span at the lats
55,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice jacket... Very nice quality. Look's and feels nice. It is comfortable. Good price.
56,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars I really like these.
57,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"I love my dress. The comfort of the material is nice, color and print is flattering."
58,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good More warmth than i expected, the brand is a great one for its price ."
59,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Super cute and comfy. Get them!! These are the cutest leggings ever! I am 130 pounds 5‚Äô4 and the small fit perfect. I prefer more of a 7/8 fit and these were a little longer on me than I normally like but I just fold them a bit and it‚Äôs perfect!!! They go up to my belly button which I like because I usually wear crop tops with them anyways. Squat proof.
60,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Good Very thin material. Perfect for summer.
61,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Watch sizes, size up from regular at least 1or 2 for good fit. Great!"
62,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"These are my new favorite workout shirts These are my new favorite workout shirts! I love the fit and, it's awesome they came in a three pack. Delivery was quick. Very pleased."
63,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Beautiful Ordering more!!! I‚Äôm a size 22/24 ordered the 5x fits amazingly I‚Äôm normally a 3 x
64,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great My husband loves these shirts! I ordered another set.
65,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Everything was great. I'm 5'4"" and the large was the perfect ... Everything was great.  I'm 5'4&#34; and the large was the perfect length for me, but it does not touch the ground (the picture shown gave me the impression it might).  Fabric is soft and I love the adjustable straps."
66,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Worth it This shirts are perfect for what you pay, the material is soft and fits well, looks really nice on."
67,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Cute! Exactly what I thought I ordered, washed well, no pilling"
68,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,It brings out your confidence when you training I like how it fits shows my traps and shoulders when I work out material doesnt stick to u on hard workout
69,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Love it! Plan to purchase more colors.
70,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Very comfortable nice feel Very comfortable nice feel
71,5,B0928FSGGD,1,great value/great style! great workout shirt. Love the colors!
72,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Super fit and style! Perfect fit and style for my 12 year old sailor!
73,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good buy Good fit but a bit long.
74,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Comfortable & stylish Comfortable & stylish
75,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great purchase! Love the sundress! A little long but was expected, everything is long on me (I'm only 5'2""). Would definitely recommend!!"
76,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"but it‚Äôs nice and fits ok It‚Äôs different than the picture. It‚Äôs a simple piece with big dots, but it‚Äôs nice and fits ok."
77,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Review Great work out t-shirts, i love them!"
78,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars This dress was perfect for my daughters cupcake birthday party! It fits her perfectly!
79,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars Dress fit perfect.
80,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"It's a keeper! This is a really cute dress with handy pockets.  It's extremely well made.  It's slightly snug around the chest, but not enough to complain about.  This one's a keeper ladies!"
81,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Excelente servicio Me encanta!!!la tela muy bonita no se despinta estira bastante
82,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Buy it but not a perfect fit I really liked this product, really because of how it looks in the gym. That being said its actually way tighter on your lats then you might expect. From the photo youd expect the arm to cut below your lats but the arm sleeve is right below your armpit which can make you feel extremely constricted. Happy to have bought once definitely would not buy again..."
83,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"I was a little worried about ordering,if they would fit right or not. I am very pleased with them. I love them, will order more later on. Very ""flattering, comfortable to wear."
84,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Four Stars nice fit. could have gone size smaller. cute cut.
85,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Love this dress I love this dress, will buy other patterns."
86,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Simple and great Great buy for price
87,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars I like the feel and look.
88,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Long! Amazing. I took it out of the package and it looked as long as capris. As someone 5'10"" I was worried. However, it stretched and fit amazingly well! Didnt move at all and was so comfy I wanted to wear it all day. So smooth. I ordered a large and I'm 5'10"", 170 pounds. The waistband rolled down a bit but overall, great."
89,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,These are amazing joggers! I‚Äôm normally wear S I‚Äôm leggings but with joggers they do tend to stretch out sun. So I got a XS. The fit great! Will buy again
90,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Adjustable straps!! Love! Wore this on vacation to the beach. Perfect summer dress!
91,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"Very Comfortable. Very comfortable tshirt dress.  Loved the color, fit, quality and price.  It was a bit long, but I am short, 5ft.  It would be great for a casual gathering.  I returned it because I wanted something for a dressy event and it was a little too long for me."
92,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"S√∫per buenas Son muy comodas, hacen bien su trabajo te protegen del sol y son s√∫per frescas, no acumulan el sudor. La verdad por el precio est√°n m√°s que sobrevaloradas"
93,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Totally Happy with this Purchase!!! I was a bit skeptical in purchasing these shirts because in the past, I bought some and didn't really care for the fit. These however, I love (thus far...just got them yesterday lol) because they don't have that totally ""hugging you body"" feel to them, if that makes sense. They ""fit"", but give your body room to breathe at the same time. I just used my phone to take quick sample pix of how they fit (without me fooling around with it to be ""picture perfect"", lol, more realistic of the wearing of the shirt).<br />I like them so much, if they wash well, I'm definitely getting more!!! Love the olive color and the fact that they aren't the type of material that attracts every single strand of cat hair that's in my apartment. üòÇ<br /><br />‚Ä¢ 5'10/11""  ‚Ä¢ 200-ish lbs (90.718 kg)"
94,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Excellent Fits as expected! all excellent
95,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Perfect color and size. Fits great.
96,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Pretty good I wish these came in tall sizes. I'm 6'4""-6'5"" and felt they were a little short."
97,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice  
98,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great price! Nice fit! These are great for lounging and not too hot for working out. I‚Äôm very happy with them. They run a little short but I feel like that‚Äôs in style now. They have held up nicely in two washes in the washing machine so far.
99,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Get a bigger size Runs a little bit small but still comfortable
100,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Very good workout tanktop I've tried many tanktops for working out, and these are just always the best fitting and best for value with the 3 packs. It does take a little getting used to if you haven't worn any of these style though."
101,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Thumbs up üëç Fits great, you can wear to work out in or play time. I bought 3 for my husband! he's very pleased üòÄ<br />Highly recommend"
102,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,SUPER HAPPY! Love the color and the fit. Super light too.
103,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Love these shirts! I like that they have a sufficient amount of stretch.
104,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"I love this shirt I love this shirt!! I got a large and I'm 130 lbs/ athletic build. I like my work out clothes a little loose, and so this was perfect. Washes well, no pilling. Really nice denim color. Covers your butt!!"
105,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Again Husband Love them was so happy I order them for him.
106,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Just what I was looking for Love this hoodie! The fit is perfect, the weight is just right (not too heavy, not too light), and the quality is excellent!"
107,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"As expected, minus color. The color is not purple at all but more of a rose color. The fit is extremely comfortable. I bought ten leggings from various brands and this one, by far, is my favorite. There is no compression with these, so they are the most ideal for yoga and, from what I can tell, underwear doesn't show through. You will see underwear lines, if that is a concern."
108,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfortable and fitted. Its fitted and soft. I'm not sure if I want to wear it on a hot summer day or wear it as a night shirt.  I can tell that the material will keep me cool and comfy.
109,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect Fit I love how it hugs your body with a comfortable feeling
110,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great fit Just what I was looking for.  Nice and long, stays tucked in"
111,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Perfect fit Fits perfectly! Great length.
112,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Four Stars A bit fitted then expected
113,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits perfectly! I love these tanks to wear under my other tops! I wear a 2x and the extra large fits me perfectly!
114,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sweatshirt purchase Great fit and great manufacture and value.
115,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Its pretty good- I just bought it too large, so i gave it to my mom..."
116,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Look good feel good Soft comfortable and warm
117,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Perfect fit! Love the way these fit, nice and comfy but still flattering."
118,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,The black ones are better than the color ones. I like the black compression tank tops. They squeeze onto your body pretty well. I would not get the color ones. I thought the color ones with the same as the black ones but they are little bit different style and they came directly from China. The three pack black versions are little bit better than the three pack color versions. The three packed color version all came individually wrapped and they seem a little bit thinner than the black ones. I recommend the black ones is the color ones.
119,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Don't order a size up Love the color and fit, I was worried about it being small but the L (US-M) fit like a large.<br />Cuts off nice in the back I normally don't like long cardigans"
120,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great shirt! Fit was great
121,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good quality Good material and well done.
122,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Great sweat pants I love the sweat pants. They are very comfortable. I ordered them too big so I could lounge around the house in them.
123,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars The sweatshirt was exactly what I expected.  Thank you
124,4,B0928FSGGD,1,La talla sale muy bien La tela esta muy buena
125,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Unique gym mesh tank, good look. These tanks are great for the gym.  Take note that these are fabric mesh and not regular pima/soft cotton.  Felt initially a little scratchy. Got better after a wash.  Hoping they don‚Äôt shrink.  I like tanks med or large.  Got these in large and very glad I didn‚Äôt go smaller!"
126,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,gym shirt good quality just didn't like the line thread on the shirt
127,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great fit, very stylish! Very nice, comfy and stylish üòÅ gonna have to get some more soon üòÅ"
128,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good for cost. I bought these for my bf and they fit true to size, I was just a little surprise with the material.<br />It was soft but because the holes on the tank top reminded of a mesh hat. But otherwise nice, my bf likes them!"
129,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great fit!! I use it for under my dress shirts.
130,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Love, but run small I love the tops but they run small. Be sure to go up a size. Not only do they run small, they also shrink in the dryer. I'm hanging to dry from now on."
131,5,B09M6X79V9,1,A+ Worth the money you spend.
132,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Impressed!!! I purchased this for my mother and I to wear around the house to keep warm to still look fly during last Christmas time. The material is sturdy and just the right thickness to keep all the warmth inside the sweater and not have you overheating. It feels great inside and out and we actually purchased another set to wear out because it looks that good to wear with leggings and boots. I recommend this to any man and woman. I'll probably buy more down the road.
133,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"cozy and comfortable. Classic, cozy and comfortable."
134,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Like it! Fits Good. Color is good. Made well
135,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Four Stars Love these! Helps keep everything in place.
136,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Thank u

138,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Comfortable I love these long sleeves very comfortable fit !
139,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good quality Love these for under scrubs. Could be a little longer tho. Otherwise love them
140,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great casual hoodie Fits as advertised.  Arms and wast length is spot on.  I've washed it in cold water 4 times now, dried it in the dryer and there hasn't been any stretching or shrinking.  It's a medium weight shirt good for every season but summer."
141,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars Not a heavy sweatshirt but should be fine.
142,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"It was crazy comfortable So comfy !! I ordered a large ,it fit nice.<br />I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô4 it went below the knee .<br />Love it , I‚Äôm getting another ."
143,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Fits like a glove Love theses leggings!!! So does my husband
144,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great leggings I would order a size up they are a little stif
145,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Bought twice I used these long sleeves for work. They fit great and are light and comfortable. They for as expected, I was nervous the size medium would fit funny because I am 150bs and 5'2&#34;. It is a little short, but I tuck them in. I actually purchased another order of three shirts and I'm thinking of buying some from my mother. As for the delivery, I told Amazon to bulk my order, I don't remember well how long it took, average I think. I'll upload pictures later"

150,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love it! Love it! This caught my eye a while back but I never ordered clothes from Amazon before so I was hesitant, but after reading the reviews, I placed my order for the black and white polka dotted dress. It arrived today and it is exactly what I hoped it would be, a comfy, flowy dress perfect for the summer. I'm 5'3 and wear a 14/16 because of my 36G bust. The XL fit perfectly, length included. I liked it so much, I will be ordering another one. My only advice is to wash in cold water and hang to dry, and not to place in the dryer. Very cute dress!"
151,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I've bought some of the cheaper brands only to be disappointed with the wear of the fabric and the elastic ...

187,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell Products are good quality I bought the sweat shirt and sweat pants for my husband.  Both are XL, his usual size, but both are larger than the usual XL. We have tried to shrink them by washing and drying on hot, but they didn't shrink much. I will have to hem up the<br />sweat pants.  Regardless, he likes them and says Russell products are quality and last a long time."

I ordered the small size. These are not long in length like some workout tank tops. Nice length though. They hit me in the hip area. They are not compression. I gave 4 stars only because the description says compression but they are not. I like them enough to keep them. I would also recommend these.

261,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Fabulous leggings and great customer service! Im always on the search for quality leggings, and I‚Äôm such a huge fan of aoxjox! I‚Äôm a short and curvier girl (with wider hips) than the typical people you see reviewing leggings online, and I find these ones to be flattering and fantastic! I got three leggings in the purple, sky blue, and forest green, and one of the leggings came with a run on the back but customer service literally sent me another one after sending pictures of the defect. They are fantastic sellers and these leggings are quality for the gym and lounging at home! All are squat proof, and the colors are so cute! The only downside is that since I am five foot one the leggings run a little longer, but I have the resources to have them fixed. I‚Äôm definitely buying more, great gymshark dupes but half the price!"

I‚Äôm normally a size 6 but ordered the Large based on reviews and it fits nicely and still a little snug. I understand that it is meant to be a compression top but I like the feeling of a hug not a squeeze:-).
267,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Cute dress This dress is cute and comfy!  Very flattering.
268,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Good Buy! My daughter and I both have a pair. We love them as they are flattering and hide any cellulite...They are comfortable to workout in or just hang out in. Great tights!
269,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Exactly what I wanted Love it!!!
270,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Overall: okay? Usually I buy a size large, in this case I did not and bought an XL instead. When I put them on they felt great! Sizing was fine, a little loose on the waist line though. Main Issue: The ankle area is way too big! Therefore, it rides up. I try to pull them down but they just come right back up. SO overall. They're good leggings, but maybe I should have gone for a tighter fit to fix the obnoxious ankles."
271,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Worth the price The material
272,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Comfy and cute! These leggings look very high end! When I took them out of the packaging and held them up, they only went halfway down my leg. But putting them, they have so much stretch and went all the way down to my ankle (I'm 5'9"") and sit above my belly button. They are super comfortable and soft! I get compliments all the time!"

278,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Its comfy I love it, It is so  comfortable. I want to buy more colors."
279,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Fits Perfectly These fit perfectly, and feel amazing. They seem to be high quality, and have survived the first few washes so far. These are not Under Armor replacements, which is what I expected, but they do a great job as workout shirts, or a base layer for hot weather activities. Definitely recommended. They fit exactly like a form-fitting medium should."
280,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Never disappointed by Russell Athletic Sweats Russell Athletic sweat shirts and pants are a staple in my wardrobe.  I have never been disappointed by any Russell Athletic product.  Quality, fit, durability and comfort are four reasons I purchase and give Russell Athletic gear."

284,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Easy, breezy, buy it Loose and flowy. SO COMFORTABLE. Has that casual, boho, effortless look that is super easy to dress up or down.

297,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Best dress ever! Perfect fit! I love this dress! The fabric is beautiful. It fits perfectly. I'm 5'4 and the length is perfect- it falls right at my ankle. It's a casual dress that is easy to dress up for something more formal if necessary. I'm going to buy another in a solid color.
298,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"The material is a bit lightweight I love the feel of this dress, the length and sleeves are just right. The material is almost see-thru."
299,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,This is good for me cuz I wear them as a base ... Im 6' 215lbs with a bit of belly and these are skin tight in a large. This is good for me cuz I wear them as a base layer for cycling. They are kinda &#34;scratchy&#34; but I think they'll get softer in time.
300,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great fit! Great fit!
301,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great fit and great price I wear these to the gym great product
302,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Color is nice The pint logo is plasticity.. and they fit big.  Size small fits like a medium.

307,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Great
308,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Buy it! I purchased a black polka dot dress in a medium.<br /><br />Shipping: the dress came fast.<br /><br />Packaging: it came in a plastic zip top bag of their company. Wrapped/folded very nicely with a tag that reminded us of posting a review.<br /><br />Product: the material was soft and light and not too thin, just perfect. I do think the seam should be in the back of the dress instead of the front, however, I believe that to have that nice high low design of the dress it can only be done by having a seam. So, the front is higher/shorter than the back, like an upside V shape. I like the style and I love the pickets too!<br /><br />Size: I usually wear a medium/large, I‚Äôm a size 10. It‚Äôs loose fitting so I bought the medium size. The front is a bit low and can show cleavage (which I barely have) even when I put it all the way up.<br /><br />Recommend: yes, absolutely! In fact, I saw my cousin wear it and then I got it a week later!"
309,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,... I ordered in Medium I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 180 pounds fits perfect I also have them in Large fits loose but ... These are true to size I ordered in Medium I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 180 pounds fits perfect I also have them in Large fits loose but I like both of them.
310,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not compression tanks If you are looking for compression tanks, then look elsewhere. These will not compress anything. They are thin, lightweight, and comfortable. They fit true to size.<br />If you are looking for a thin tank to use for layering, then this is it! I love it for that purpose. Also, the black and grey are not see through, so I wear them alone during the summer.<br />It‚Äôs not what I expected when I purchased these, but I ended up keeping them since they have other uses. Just please now, these are not compression tanks at all."
311,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Better than usual shirts!! Very nice sweat shirts....
312,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,A A
313,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Perfect Absolutely love this!!!!
314,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good shirt for the cost Good quality shirt for those of you who do not like sleeves during your workout. I find they do not prohibit movements during exercise which is a good thing.
315,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,These are perfect! Buy them!!! Just got these in the mail. Wore them last night for the first time on my way to the ER. They fit perfect and are so comfortable. I am planning on buying 2 more. Buy them. You won‚Äôt regret it. I got medium and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 135lbs.
316,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Four Stars slightly big.
317,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Breathable Love these workout tops, very breathable and awesome design."
318,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"They just feel right I love these shirts.  I want more of them. Fit is great,  material feels good.  They look nice."
319,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I love the straps adjust I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 135 lbs and a DD. After reading the reviews I got a medium and it fits perfectly. I love the straps adjust, and the pockets. I‚Äôve only hand washed it because it‚Äôs not the best quality. The stitching in the front where the ‚ÄúV‚Äù is looks like it might be coming undone, and there‚Äôs a small hole in the pocket, nothing not fixable. It‚Äôs perfect for summer weather though, very lightweight. You do get what you pay for."
320,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Tight at the bottom This is a nice weight hoodie, also warm.  However, it is a bit tight at the bottom. I have a slender physique and was surprised how narrow it is.  I guess I could stretch it out. Other than that, it's a great hoodie."
321,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great fit for coverup This dress is great. I purchased this as a cover up for a beach vacation and it‚Äôs nearly perfect. The only complaints I have is the material seems like it could shrink so I‚Äôll avoid the drier but it also seems to wrinkle. The only other issue is the pockets are a little too low for my liking they hit at an awkward length but the way the dress is cut it doesn‚Äôt look awkward it‚Äôs just not as functional as I had hoped. 5‚Äô4‚Äù 130 bought a small and the length hits right at the ankles
322,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Best value you can find, and great for taller guys My boyfriend is 6'4 and has trouble finding clothes long enough that are not too wide.  The medium option was perfect for him at 6'4 and muscular 210lbs.  Shorter guys may find it hits under the butt, but for him it is just below the belt and perfect.  No tummy showing during overhead press!"
323,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Awesome Awesome
324,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,It fits great This hoodie was great. It fit well
325,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Comfortable, quality pants Sometimes size guides can be tricky. I'm 5'5, 118 lbs, and decided to go with an XS. I don't like baggy pants in general, even with sweatpants. These fit well for me, and I do have decent size hips, and they still fit fine; not tight, and not baggy. My inseam is short (about 27""),so  I normally purchase pants from the juniors department. These pants are a pinch long, but the closed bottom hem does a good job of preventing the material from spilling onto the floor while I walk, without being too tight at the bottom either.  I use these mainly as lounge pants and they have washed well. The pockets fit my Samsung Note 10+, although it does slightly hang out the side at the top, but keys, slim wallets, etc fit deep inside without a problem. I bought these in a few colors and I think the price makes it a good deal.<br />Edit: I bought the Blue Yonder Heather one and although the size label was what I ordered, the fit was way off.. closer to a medium or large, when I ordered a XS. The print was different too. The other colors I ordered were fine though."
326,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"very comfortable sweats. Will be ordering different colors for the ... Fit as expected, very comfortable sweats.  Will be ordering different colors for the winter."
327,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,must buy ! like that the material is jersey like and made very well not only are they comftorable they are very soft
328,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Comfortable light weight Very comfortable and light weight
329,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good I wish I would‚Äôve ordered a small. After reading the reviews, I ordered medium. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 130lbs, slender build. The mediums are not fitting as they should be. I think a small would‚Äôve been perfect. The materials and stitching seems to be good quality, though."
330,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Excellent product for the price
331,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice I love Russell Gear I have been wearing it since I was a kid.
332,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great dress Love the feel of this dress! Perfect dress for vacation soon! Fits snug at the chest and then flares out to hide body flaws!
333,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits great Love them. Flattering and breathable. Prefect for under shirt. Not sure I'd call them compression shirts but they are tightish and help my figure. Will order more. Ordered XXL when weighing about 220.  but have lost weight and will buy more!
334,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nothing better in the winter than a roomy Nothing better in the winter than a roomy, comfortable sweatshirt at a great price! Perfect for around the house, going to the gym, walking the dog, or running errands."

341,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"It works Just as some other reviewers have mentioned, the sleeves are a little too big/wide. Other then that, I love the fit and feel of sweatshirt."
342,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Caucual and comdy Very comfortable dress and you can dress it up and down.
343,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Recomendaciones Producto recomendado, muy bonito color y dise√±o."
344,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"No Complaints It isn't as thick as I hoped, but it fits and I've washed it and worn it twice.  No issues with too much shrinkage or obvious early damage from light use."
345,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Best Pair of Sweatpants I Have Ever Owned! Comfortable, sits mid waist (like it's not high-waisted and it doesn't fall down!) It's not too long, and it's flattering in the back!"
346,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Perfect undershirt I bought these to wear under my scrubs and they are perfect. I usually wear a large but I bought XL to ensure the sleeves would be long enough. I am 5'8"" and sleeves can easily be too short but these fit well. They are also snug but not skin tight and the material does not cling to my scrubs. Highly recommend!"
347,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"These Are Great The fabric is very breathable. I normally wear a small, but ordered a medium to have more room to move around. These are great and for a good price."
348,5,B09M6X79V9,1,It was a goodbye and fit as expected. Comfortable fit nice and great for working out or as an under Cami.

Feel even better with age. .I listened to a few of the reviews that said this item ran too large &amp; to order one size smaller than you would normally wear. Don't listen to them!  Like me!  I'm 6'2&quot; 190lbs.44&quot; chest 35 in,arm length.. I ordered a medium it fit too perfect,  not the comfortable fit i was looking for.

353,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great Yoga Shirt but order 1 size larger for normal fit I read the review that said to order one size up for a normal fit; I did, and the fit was great.  If you want a body-hugging shirt, then order your size. If you like them baggy, go 2 sizes up.  Remember, these were designed to hug the body!  :)  The quality is lovely as is the fit.  I normally buy small, but ordered medium and it fits like a small.  I am petite and the sleeves were not too long."

415,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Good for Loose Fitting Workout Tops I'm about 5' 3"" at 120 lbs. I ordered two mediums because I like my workout clothes to be loose and a little bit bigger, but a small probably would have been a better fit. The tanks are a little longer than I would like, but that is fix easily by tying the top to the side. The material is light and comfortable. Overall happy with them!"
416,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Seems more like a regular tank. Helps a little but not as much as I'd like. Thought it would help more with sculpting.
417,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Good product as a fair price Good product as a fair price.  I would probably buy the next smaller size time.  I purchased the XXL and would try the XL next time.  The XXL is a nice fit, but I would want a little tighter next time.  6'3"" 240 lbs"

442,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Worth the buy Good price. Washed only a few times and still holding up. I read the reviews for sizing and fits as expected.
443,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"good quality, but a little Solid sweatshirt, good quality, but a little overpriced"
444,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love the pockets! Material is nice and I love the pockets. The polka dots are big and not really a navy blue like picture. I will still wear this dress, it is very comfy."
445,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Order a size up One of the shirts run smaller than the others. They all ride up while exercising.

448,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Cute for a cheap dress Liw quality fabric but like the style and fit.
449,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"USA Sizing! Fits unexpectedly perfect. I am a 5 ' 10"" male who weighs 305 and wears a 2XL-3XL in a USA size. Was worried it was going to be a tiny Chinese shirt. Buying more right away!"

454,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice sweatshirt Really soft material and just heavy enough for cooler weather.
455,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,SOFT AND LIGHT! PERFEVT FOR A HOT DAY It is soooo soft and airy. Perfect for a hot summer day! I am 5'7&#34; 160 pounds and I got the XL because I love it to be long and comfy. Its so soft and light that I want to sleep in it. It is long and the side pockets are perfect as well.
456,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Good buy Like the dress thought it was longer than it is

462,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,üëçüèº Great shirts. Glad I got them
463,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Great for Heat Pressing! I make custom T shirts and other clothing items like this locally. I order everything from a specific place but sometimes i will order single pieces from amazon when someone places order shortly after i already made my weekly- 2 week clothing purchase for orders. The price is great because my supplier would charge 10 bucks shipping on my order if it isn't over a certain amount so here i just pay 2.00 more and still have a good turn around time on my products (: which is what i strive for! My customers love this brand, I personally don't like hoodies because of the tightness around neck but i wear them anyways and cut a little slit at the neckline...i prefer sweatshirts and they have those in this brand too which is great and a variety of colors to choose from."
464,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect replacement I like the weight of the Russell hoodie. Comfortable and warm. This is a replacement for one that had seen better days.
465,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars THE CHILDREN LOVED THEM
466,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,The large fits true to size The reviews stated that the shirt was running a bit large so I ordered a large instead of an extra large for my husband.  I should have stuck with the extra large.  It looks like a nice sweat shirt and I will probably order a couple in his size.
467,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Very cute My daughter loves this crazy cat dress. Lol

472,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars My husband likes these sweatshirts because they are not too tight in the wrists.
473,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Material Feels a little too JV not enough Varsity if you catch my drift
474,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Color and quality üëå Nice
475,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great for the price Good material for the price, wish the hood itself was a little smaller tho."
476,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Corren muy grande si deseas te ajuste, debes tomar una talla menos El material es lycra excelente calidad"
477,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not really long, but I am 6' so.... I really like these tanks, but they aren't that long. Of course I'm very tall, so that may be the issue =)"
478,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Comfortable and fit as expected I liked the fit, it fits as expected. I am always worried about size up or down. But,didn't have to with these. Ordered 3 pairs, in different colors. Its not sweat pants minerals, its Terrycloth and lightweight. Comfortable"

482,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Big +A Awesome
483,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Amazing Great product definitely getting more. Just as I expected from a great company.
484,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Fits' perfect I'm 5' 10"", 190 lbs., athletic, large fit's perfect! Medium thickness. Love that the waist line and wrist's fit snug, unlike the Champion I bought before, fit like a dress. Great hoodie, I'll buy another"
485,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Get‚Äôs the job done Fits my fat body good. Only complaint is that the front pockets are a two small for my hands but at least it fits great. Can‚Äôt beat the price either.
486,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Similar to gym shark but not a dupe I ordered these in my normal gymshark sizing and although they looked small they fit well. I wanted a gymshark dupe and these are similar but a little thicker material but slightly see through at the same time, they‚Äôre a more solid black than the picture and a bit of a different material than gymshark but still stay up when I‚Äôm running, they will not be my lifting leggings unfortunately."
487,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Comfy and beautiful joggers. I just love these joggers, I've bought them in several in colors already, and my sister has donde the same too. So comfortable and beautiful."
488,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice workout shirts I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 175 pounds small fit me nice<br />I‚Äôm not that muscular so a smaller size would be tighter on me and I‚Äôd be ok but the small is great too
489,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Durable and affordable! Really liked the product great fit! True to size and works great for they gym !
490,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great Amazon find! I am typically between sizes (S & M). I first order a size small and though they fit, I did find them a tad too tight. Once I ordered the Mediums they were perfect! The material feels sturdy and they are squat proof. I am very short at 5'1"" and these are just the right length on me. Don't even have to roll up the bottoms like I usually do. Would recommend! Can't wait to order more colors."
491,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Nice for hot weather. Hate the pockets. Wow, this dress is great for hot weather, as it‚Äôs light & airy, but not so sheer that it‚Äôs see through. The straps are adjustable like bra straps, and for my 4‚Äô11‚Äù frame, when fully tightened, the dress is still a ‚Äúlong‚Äù dress, but no tailoring required.<br /><br />It will be perfect with a light sweater or on its own. I did deduct a point because i don‚Äôt like pockets in dresses in the first place (they make your hips look bigger), but these pockets are HUGE & don‚Äôt seem to be sewn entirely straight so I couldn‚Äôt just stitch them closed with my sewing machine like I normally do & remove the pockets.<br /><br />I do recommend this dress, as it‚Äôs great for vacation, hides side boob or when it‚Äôs too hot for pants!!!!"
492,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Five Stars Lightweight and comfy. Loose enough sleeves for slightly chubby arms without looking bulky.
493,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Soft, warm and perfect fit It's hard to find a good fitting hoodie in bigger sizes but this one is perfecr. Not too tight like most brands at 3XL and above and incredibly soft. Best hoodie I've bought in years. If you're a bigger guy you can't go wrong with this one."
494,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Cozy, cute, & affordable ‚ò∫Ô∏è I was looking for a simple cozy oversized hoodie to wear throughout the winter. This is decently priced, very comfortable and cute! I am 5‚Äô10 and i got the XL for a slightly oversized look and i love it :) would recommend getting a size up for extra comfort ! would recommend."
495,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Four Stars A bit shorter than expected, but fits well."
496,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love it Love this hoodie and the comforting feeling.

502,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Thank you. Really comfortable and nice design.
503,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Want in every color! Love everything about it and this is my fav pair of pants in my wardrobe!  I prefer higher waste to hide stomach pouch and these are perfect. Fit is very comfy and I go from casual soccer mom to out on the town in these pants! They don‚Äôt show every dimple because they are not super tight like a normal cotton legging around the leg. The material feels buttery soft but also somewhat like a track suit and doesn‚Äôt stick to my legs. Loving the cuff at the ankle. I ordered 3 already!
504,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,love but love the color and fabric though it has no compression what so ever . So if you have a pouch that‚Äôs not for you.
505,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect summer party dress! The perfect light summer party dress... LOVE it!!
506,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,He loves it Looks great.
507,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"I love these! I ordered these from a tiktok lady, and oh my gosh, these are so soft and so comfortable. the waist band is thick but not to where it‚Äôs uncomfortable, it gives the tummy control that most girls want! i wore them to the gym yesterday and felt completely secure and they didn‚Äôt roll down when i walked on the treadmill or anything! 10/10 recommend, i‚Äôll be ordering another pair of these!"
508,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Excelente calidad Buena tela, no se transparenta, sentador, halagador ycomodo"

513,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice hoodie Awesome hoodie. Material is soft. It's a medium to lightweight hoodie so it's great for different conditions. Fits how I thought it would. All in all I'm very pleased with the quality. It is however on the more expensive side.
514,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"These work great I love these. They work great under my uniform shirts.  My office is so cold, these help keep my upper body warm without being bulky."
515,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Very comfortable and lightweight Very comfortable and lightweight
516,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars these look great on my husband and he wears them everyday.
517,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love! Got the Black Marl and Tie Dye Black Gray. Squat proof and comfortable to work out in.
518,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love the dress Love the dress, very comfy.  There was a small flaw in the actual material!  I know it's there but, know one else does"
519,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Very comfortable yet supportiive
520,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Thinner Than Expected but Still Good I'm really glad I got the Medium, as it fits perfectly. (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 114lbs) The fabric is a little thinner than I expected from looking at the photos. But overall, these are great. Good for layering or just wearing by itself. I like the Gray and Blue, but the Pink color is a bit too bright for me. But overall, I like them."
521,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Squat approved!! Love this pants! Got one just to test them and then ended up buying 5 of them!! They are amazing!! Will keep buying them for sure.. perfect for working out legs
522,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,I love it! I love the fit of this dress. I can't wait to wear it at a function that's coming up!
523,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,All good Fit perfect / Right north american size
524,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good fit The fit was just at the level of my waist it may shrink after first wash
525,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great for work out Love these tops! No rolling up, wick away moisture, and don't hold onto odor. Will order again!"
526,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love this dress I bought the black polka-dot one first and I LOVE how it fits, I'm 5'4"" and about 175 and the large fit perfectly.  I have a hard time with long dresses being waaay too long but this dress is the perfect length.  I loved it so much that I bought the red one too. Now I haven't wore them yet because it's still winter so I don't know how they will hold up. But for now I am very happy with this dress."
527,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfection when it comes to tanks I sweat a lot at the gym, and these tanks will not let you drip, nor look make you look like you've been poured on. I love how breathable the material is, and how they look on me. They give that allusion that I'm buff and muscular, when I'm just ok lol."
528,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Silky feeling on your skin Fits as expected
529,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Very comfortable

534,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"nice quality, fit is a little off I like this sweatshirt alot. it is the perfect wieght, and good quality. the only problem is that the sleeves are a little baggy. the sweatshirt definetly runs big, get one size down from your normal size. I always wear medium. I bought a small and it fit great."
535,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars great pullover hoodie .... no shrinkage  or color loss.

538,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love the dress Love the dress! Very comfortable and loose. I wish it was a little thicker fabric because it is quite see through, but I love it!"
539,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"it fits fine. Definitely Asian sizing on this product. I ordered a medium and usually wear a small. Otherwise, it fits fine."
540,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable fit Very thick, fits well"

550,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Our granddaughter really likes it
551,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"RAD. AWESOME. BEAUTIFUL? These sweatshirts are inexpensive and comfortable. I got mine in black and I love it. You can wear them out for a casual night on the town if you layer it with a light jacket or you can basically live in it when you avoid studying for finals and decide to spend a week on the couch eating junk food and drinking too much beer. I'm 6ft/180lbs with a pretty average build. I can usually get away with wearing a medium, but I anticipated a little shrinkage in the wash (which happened btw) and I opted for the large. Intuition-1, dryer-0.<br /><br />The only downside was a slight unraveling of the thread on the left side of the pocket, which my girlfriend easily sewed up. Bless her heart. My only concern is that the unraveling also happened to a friend of mine, but that shouldn't be enough to deter anyone from purchasing this awesome sweatshirt.<br /><br />Do it. You know you want to."
552,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I absolutely love the fit This is the only brand and style of sweatshirt I wear. I absolutely love the fit, and the temperature is perfect. Not too hot, just right."
553,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Fit Perfect but so did the medium Fit Perfect but so did the medium. I belted mine and Ive worn them both. Super comfortable and they hang nice, Im 5'4 117 small chested slender built."
554,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"The item fit well and is very comfortable. The use of this product is to walk on the track, etc."
555,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good for the price No complaints really, I wish the material was slightly different, more cotton feel, but I understand it had to be that way for moisture purposes. I‚Äôd buy again"
556,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,An avid runner This pack has lasted me a couple of year. I used these shirts for all my runs specially during winter. A good buy and worth the price.
557,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Everyone likes to be comfortable I actually bought this for my daughter she like how the mens hoodies have a better weight to them..Will get more for other family members maybe even myself..
558,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Fit is incredible. Great quality That these have a great fit and are super cute and comfortable.
559,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfecto! Me queda tal como se ve en la foto. El vestido lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones
560,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,THIS IS THE LEGGING YOU NEED BEST AMAZON WORKOUT LEGGINGS. True to size! So flattering. I have tried 3 different leggings from other brands on Amazon and this one is the BEST. So happy I found it. I will be buying in every single color!!!!!!!!
561,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars These work perfectly as an alternative to the cotton shirts I was wearing as undershirts.
562,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great joggers Really glad I bought these. Very comfy
563,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Comfortable This product is very nice, great material, comfortable and fit perfectly. I weight 152 Lbs., height 5'10"", chest size 37.5"", they fit perfectly, very happy with this product."
564,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Cute and looks like picture I wear this so much around the house.  Looks super cute over a tank top with jeans
565,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Good sweatshirt value Just as expected!
566,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Really thick legging Great legging for working out! I‚Äôve only worn them twice to high intensity workouts but they‚Äôre great because they don‚Äôt slide down, very firm fitting. They are on the thicker side but I like that for these types of workouts. I would say they are true to size and have held up after washing twice!"
567,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Nicely made and great price I needed these for my 5 mile walks and hiking trips.  The dry fit material works well.  They run very small.  I wear a S or M, and got a large, which worked out for me."
568,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"he's elderly & gets cold easily! Very nice The thickness is what he needed, he's elderly & gets cold easily! Very nice!!"
569,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,good quality I like the fit and would order these again.
570,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweatshirt Stays soft and comfortable. Holds its shape very well.
571,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Love this Racerback Tank I really like these racerback tanks. I ordered the three pack of black, gray and white. I agree with other reviewers they run a bit large and thankfully I paid attention to this. I am 5'7 and 135 pounds, usually wear a medium but sized down to a small and am glad I did. Fits perfectly! Some reviewers complain that these tanks are not really compression - I disagree with that. They are LIGHT compression - nothing like Spanx mind you - but who wants that for everyday activities and workouts. I find that they do light shaping and compression. Very comfortable to wear! Will likely purchase additional colors."
572,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Five Stars Great value and they look great on me
573,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits perfect It is exactly as ordered
574,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,I needed to order my regular size I did not find the medium to be any bigger than other mediums and had to return for a large.
575,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Too big I ordered this for the compression but the sizing chart is off, so it does not offer any compression. The size chart suggested large for my measurements. I should have gotten medium or even a small. Nice material, though and does not ride up. Good value, though (you get 3 in a pack just like the picture)."
576,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"5 Star for sure! Wow these are nice shirts!  My chest measures 46&#34;, so I wasn't sure if XL would cut it, but they fit and feel great.  I've been wearing them as an undershirt on hot days with v-neck shirts to control the sweat...  Have only had them a week, but they appear well made.  Can't beat them considering the reasonable price."
577,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Fit tight and are semi see through They fit very tight around the hips and waist. If you do not like tight leggings size up.
578,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good
579,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Just try them! I've ordered 5 of these leggings now, 1 because my dog ate them - but all the others because I needed all the different colors! I finally ordered a charcoal as well. Currently I have Charcoal, Blue, Pink, Purple, and Red (Eaten). I'm short, 5'3"" and 155 and order a Medium. I wash and dry them normally - nothing fancy and have had them hold up really well. Highly recommend! They hit my ankle with a tiny bit of bunch. Squat proof and sweatproof! I only have the Merle ones though. I havent tried any other designs."
580,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"SQUAT PROOF I would put 5 stars but there are some discrepancies between the material for each color. The black is AMAZING. Thick fabric, fits as expected, just great overall. I then purchased the grey... much thinner & stretchier fabric (still squat proof), & run a little bit bigger than the black. THEN I ordered the light blue ombr√©... different fabric than the others I ordered, even bigger than the grey pair, & the fabric was thinner than the black pair but similar to grey (still squat proof).<br />I love these tights, esp bc I reverted to them for a cheaper option after having 3 pairs of gym shark tights.<br />Don‚Äôt let this review stop you from ordering, they‚Äôre great for the price & quick shipping BUT just be mindful to not expect perfection when you get them. Unless you order the black :) also I ordered a M in all - returning the ombr√© for a small to see if that works better. I‚Äôm 140lb, 5‚Äô8 & wear a medium from gym shark & typically a size 6 in jeans. Hope this helps!"
581,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Soft fabric! I love this dress and it looks great on my daughter! Very soft, lightweight fabric, stretchy but not tight fitting, cottony feel but very smooth, casual but girly enough and it's just right size-wise as she is an average 7/8. The colors are bright and it's better than I expected :-) Very happy with this dress!"
582,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Nice hoodie Nice hoodie for the price
583,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Perfect! Material is thinner thab other known brands, but it does the job and they look cute and fitted"
584,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Larger chested ladies...need to wear bra underneath. Nice top, but big. I'm 32DD and thinner build. I ordered XS and it fits just right. Definately need to wear sports bra underneath bc no support. Material thinner than my other workout tops. I gave 4 stars bc these will not make it to the gym for me, which is why I placed the order. Instead are perfect to wear with shorts on hot day."
585,5,B07XD71F1H,1,So versatile The first time I wore it was with some knee high black boots. I felt very sexy. The second time was with some black sandals and I felt relaxed. Love how this dress fits and can fit into any situation.
586,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Soft. Comfortable. Best hoodie! Fit is true to size. Ultimate in comfort and softness.  Highly recommend
587,4,B09M6X79V9,1,A little snug but comfy They are a bit snug but I really like them for layering.
588,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Cheaper than Store options The tanks are comfortable, lightweight, and fit perfectly for myself as a runner. They aren‚Äôt constricting and the razorback design in the back is just what I was looking for."
589,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Definitely buy this dress!!!! Omg! Absolutely perfect! I would probably buy it in all the colors!
590,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice hoodie Been looking for a decent hoodie and I‚Äôve found it.  Nice fit and size was perfect

593,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Looked great on her. She loved it
594,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Comfortable and cute! I wore this dress all the time last summer! It's not the highest quality, very lightweight, but worked perfectly as a casual summer dress. It's fairly sheer, but I didn't feel uncomfortable wearing it, with the dark polka dot pattern you couldn't clearly see my bra or underwear. The adjustable straps were nice since the top initially fit a little wonky. Great for the price."
595,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great for traveling I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and wish they were a little longer in length.  But, keeping them due to the quality,  comfort and the high wasted fit. Easy to pack for your travels."
596,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,GOOD BUY RUSSELL MAKES GOOD STUFF
597,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Better than I thought it would be Bought the black, grey & olive set. Material & fit is actually better than I thought it would be. A lot of the time you order something and what u get, is nothing like the pictures. This is not one of those times. Will be ordering more."
598,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"BUY THIS DRESS This is going to be a staple in my spring/ summer wardrobe. I'm about 5'1&#34; and a 10-12. I got the XL because I was nervous about non-stretch fabric over my D cup bust and it fits nicely! There are adjustable straps which is great. The fabric is thin and breezy but not see through. It has POCKETS. Deep, useful pockets. I sent this link to half the girls I work with because everyone loved it so much. It's super versatile - I wore it with a long black cardi and black mules, but I can see it with a denim jacket, you can belt it, wear with sandals or wedges, etc. The low back makes it pretty with nothing over it as well.<br /><br />I got it in black. I'll also be buying the navy and the red. Wish it came in more Colors!"

622,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Cute! Liked softness
623,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Love I got this hoodie for a festival camping trip and it is perfect. The fit is a little weird though, I'm a small but wanted something a little loose so I got the medium. The sleeves are way large, the neck and waist band part are tight. Regardless, this is the best hoodie ever. It's so comfortable and kept me warm on those cold camping nights. I washed it once and it still looks vibrant and I think it shrunk in all the right places. I'll be ordering again from here defiantly"
624,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love it I like the fit of this zip hoodie. It keeps me warm on chilly days and is good as a jacket on mild weather days. The quality of this hoodie is great. Washed it a few times and the color is not fading nor is the stitching deteriorating.

Squat proof, hugs me just right (they even give me a lil booty which is great because my booty is borderline nonexistent lmao), the length is perfect! Not gunna lie when I first opened the package I was scared because they looked very small, but they stretch, WHEW BOY DO THEY STRETCH! I ordered a SMALL because I'm normally a small pants (size 3-5) and they are perfect. I honestly could've ordered an XS because they stretch that much but these are still perfect nonetheless."
630,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Comfortable. The sides aren't cut all the way down, which I like. Nice quality shirts. Mine do smell like something burned in the warehouse, but I'm hoping that goes away after the wash."
631,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,they fit great and are very nice for the gym workout and ... Was worried about fit with being a wicking and workout shirt...they fit great and are very nice for the gym workout and running.

635,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"pullover hoodie Absolutely love the color of this hoodie! First time I have every actually seen such a bright pink hoodie! Delivery was fast. The only issue I have is that after reading a few reviews I decided to go one size bigger than I would normally wear, and it would be great but the arms of the hoodie are humungous! Haven't washed it yet, hoping it will shrink just a little."

641,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"My new favorite workout leggings! I purchased these on a whim and I‚Äôm so glad I did. They are incredibly comfortable and flattering, even if you are lacking in the backside.

642,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars great fit and good material.
643,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great item Great sweatshirt
644,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Light breathable Pretty good for the price , nice and light for hot weather,  fit could be a bit better around arm holes , will last at least 30 to 40 washes and start to get a bit looser and worn .. but overall good for price."
645,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"High-waisted everyday joggers. These joggers are soft and comfortable. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh 130.  I wanted them to fit loose and longer, so I purchased a large."

651,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars I like it very much!!
652,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Absorb sweat great I bought these to be tight fitting under T-shirts and polos. This overweight guy seems to sweat a lot in the upper torso area, and these tight fitting tanks wick the sweat away before it makes my outer shirt wet."
653,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Pleased Quality, price"
654,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"love this hoody feels like the right thing, not flimsy or like weird nylon and plastic..."

656,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Fun beach dress A really cute dress
657,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Everythings Great. Great sweatshirts. Bought 2 a couple months ago and just recently before Christmas bought 2 more. I'm 165lbs and 5'9&#34; with a normal build and the Medium size fits great. It definitely shrinks a tiny bit after washing but if I bought a large it would've been way to big even after washing. With all that said I'm still eventually going to buy 2 more. Haha so that should tell you this is a great crew neck for this price anywhere. And lastly all the colors I have (black,ash,maroon,purple) were true to thier colors in the pictures."
658,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Four Stars nice sweater really cozy. would recommend
659,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"This sweatshirt is a good value in my opinion Fits well, the color is exactly as depicted in the photo, and has gone through one wash cycle without any shrinkage or pilling or loss of color.  Very good value for the money spent."
660,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,great hoodie it is a nice hoodie
661,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,If my grandson is going to like them. I can't really say until Christmas I bought them for him.  This is what he wanted..
662,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Four Stars ordered larger because of past items but was a little bigger!
663,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Ok I liked these for compression and they look good on your legs but they do this weird thing that pushes any stomach fat you have downwards rather than sucking it in. Not a good look
664,5,B009R09Z8W,1,love it I love this sweatshirt very warm good quality will buy again in different color
665,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Buy Me!! Feels great and looks awesome
666,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good quality sweatshirt.
667,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars My brother loved it
668,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Love these hoodies!! Absolutely love these hoodies!! They are soft and comfortable. I've now bought 2 for myself in different colors and one for my boyfriend.
669,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Average quality but comfortable. I use it for lounging with family. I did not follow their size recommendations because I  don't order my hoodies the same size as my shirts. I literally want it to be bigger and fit over whatever clothing so I always go up a size.
670,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Really like these shirts Really like these shirts.  I had bought the pack of black ones earlier and wanted to get some grey/white to replace my older undershirts.  I do find that the grey ones fit a bit shorter than the white and black ones.  Not sure why, as they seem to be the same design.  Either way, they are still very comfortable and appear to be well made.  I'm 6'4&#34; and around 200lbs.  These fit comfortably.  They feel snug to the body, but not tight.  I like the fabric and how it allows your outer shirt to glide over it without bunching up.  4 stars because of the grey fit, otherwise a solid deal."
671,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Better than expected. Better than expected!  It's been hot here and the dress felt great. I like the high/low front too. Pretty happy with it for $20.
672,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable and Durable I own a couple Russell hoodies.  They fit as expected and wash without shrinking.  No complaints.
673,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Love them! Fits and fills nice!
674,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great tops Love them! The colors are great, the fit is fantastic. Great product."
675,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great I speed hours in the direct sun. Keeps me cooler that normal.
676,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Four Stars the items were delivered very quickly. thank you.
677,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Comfortable, breathable tanks to show off the guns My new favorite tanks. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2, 200lbs. Went with the XL and they‚Äôre just right. Not too tight, not super loose. I wear an XL in most t-shirts as well so you should probably just go with whatever size you normally wear unless you want a tighter fit.  The length is good, sits below the belt close to my pockets. The jersey material is breathable but doesn‚Äôt feel cheap or thin. I would definitely recommend them."
678,5,B009R09Z8W,1,A lot better than other brands. Get price for a great product Good fit very comfortable
679,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Ok As described
680,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Love this sweatshirt. Just the right weight.
681,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Will buy more! Fits very well. Very comfortable. Love these tops.
682,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Looking Cool When I'm Hot These shirts are great for exercising.  I love the way they wick moisture quickly away and cool me right down after I exercise.  They also look so very nice on the body.  Very flattering the way that the seams are placed.  I ordered my usual size small and the fit is spot on.  The colors are fashionable and flattering, as well."
683,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,plus size it is not. just to small great colors
684,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Perfect It fit just right. I work out 5 days a week for competing and I have a muscular build. I have a V shape body frame and I ordered a large. It fits perfect.
685,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Amazing air flow These tank tops are great because they‚Äôre hella airy for working out in. They also are portioned perfectly to show of the shoulders and lats haha. Oh and they‚Äôre really comfortable
686,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell products are great This lived up to to Russell brand.  Has not been washed a bunch of times and that is the true test.
687,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great for price and in general. Great for the price and number of shirts, these are wonderful!  I don't overheat and they fit just as expected, no peak-a-boo's."
688,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Exceeded expectations so far! Love them! Cannot express how comfortable & breathable they are.
689,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Hoodie Very comfortable and soft.  I purchased for myself, female 5‚Äô3‚Äù 34F.  It fits exactly as i wanted  it to - great with leggings!"
690,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars good
691,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice Product Everything about the product is really nice except for the fact that the sizes are not to be expected a small wears more like a medium, so its not able to compress as the product discribed."
692,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Good value for product Great material and comfy for working iut
693,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Wow for the price It‚Äôs great
694,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Comfortable These are comfortable pants and they are accurately sized.
695,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good Good
696,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sweat Shirts Good product. Fit as expected.
697,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great leggings I love the product and would buy again!
698,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Very nice top Very nice top. Lovely colors!
699,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love Love these! Got them in several colors. One of the colors came with looser ankles. It was one of the $10 styles so Maybe that is why they didn‚Äôt fit as good. Otherwise they fit nice in the stomach and ankle and just loose enough everywhere else. They stay up during a work out including Vollyball.
700,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Not compression I'm a solid small based on their size chart and these ""compression"" shirts are baggy. They fit like a normal shirt would, with some room to move. If you want a tight fit and have that compression feel like it's advertised for, I'd size down."
701,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good brand I love this brand! It's always high quality for a reasonable price
702,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Perfect fit Perfit fit. Would order again.

706,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfect Love this dress!! Super comfortable, material is good for the price, not too sheer.  Easy to just throw on and go with a cute pair of sandals.  I‚Äôm short and this length is actually perfect for me, fits my bust well too which can at times be an issue.  Overall great product."
707,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great shirt My favorite tanks, shows off back muscles."
708,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"AMAZING! Exactly like Gymshark Vital Seamless without out the brand new, same size and material!"
709,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Love these tank tops These fit great! I‚Äôll be buying more for sure
710,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Excellent running shirt Outstanding fit, feels great! Used primarily as a running shirt"
711,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"It fits nicely except for the underarm area It fits nicely except for the underarm area: too large for me, a small woman.  Otherwise, it is a quality sweatshirt."
712,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits perfect! Very happy with these - am actually going to order more in different colors!
713,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice tank tops Perfect fit xl
714,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars none
715,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Love those! Loved them, very slimming and fitting, waiting to see how they hold to wash. If they hold will buy 2 more pairs, best leggings ever."
716,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,husband likes Washes nice
717,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"They are a great fit, easy to clean and looks extremely well They are a great fit, easy to clean and looks extremely well, under anything I wear. It enhances my physique tremendously!"
718,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sweatshirt Nice weight to this sweatshirt
719,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Simply a great hoodie! First, Amazon seems to have a minor glitch in their system as what I ordered--and received--is a green hoodie, not blue. I was swayed primarily by the price and what seemed like exactly the color I wanted.<br /><br />I was beyond excited when I opened the package and found that the item was perfect in every way. It's very soft, a great medium weight so not too thick or too thin. It's got a nice pocket pouch, accessible with either hand, and hoodie is the perfect size for my slightly large head. And the color is a very beautiful medium green, exactly the shade I was hoping for.<br /><br />I work in a food distribution warehouse, spending 30 to 60 minutes at a time in both ambient and refrigerated areas. I wear a t-shirt under this hoodie and find that I get neither too hot nor too cold in either section of the warehouse without need for a jacket or anything else.<br /><br />In short, I highly recommend this hoodie. It's the best I've ever owned, which is saying a lot."
720,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Cute Item fits as described. Much nicer in person.
721,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Stretchy doesn't shrink Great.smooth material doesn't get full of fuzz material is very durable too.
722,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"They run small They are a little snug, but one size bigger if you like them a loose. They do shrink up a little in the wash, but are comfortable."
723,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars good
724,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great joggers! I really love these joggers! Really great quality for the price. They have a ton of stretch. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 147 lbs with a very athletic build. My legs are a lot thicker than my waist so I went with a medium.<br />I‚Äôm an athletic trainer so I bought these for work. I will say I‚Äôll likely buy a large next time so they‚Äôre not as fitted. I love the fit for outside of work but for work I like things being less clingy! Overall super happy with my purchase!"
725,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great quality product at a fair price Russell continues to make the best sweatshirts at a decent price.
726,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Quality product at fair price Shirts are quality, comfortable material & they look nice.<br /><br />The fit is a little loose in the waist so the shirt ‚Äúhangs‚Äù a bit. I think that‚Äôs the style of these though. The back hangs low Which is good & shirts are pretty long compared to others.<br /><br />Material is a bit cheaper than others & probably will fray/pill easily. Still HIGHLY recommend for price on a 3 pack considering how nice they actually are."
727,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Comfortable shirt, colors look good Comfy shirts! Light weight and fit well. Cannot complaint."
728,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Runs extremely small. Runs very small. I am 5'9"" about 180lbs. DD . I normally order extra large shirts for extra room for the girls. The shirts that came were 3XL (don't know how that happned) but they fit perfectly. I have never worn a 3XL in my life,  this is the one exception."
729,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,So comfortable Love this dress.  Will order another!
730,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great comfort Love these and have now bought many! Great for everyday wear!
731,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars I love it exactly  what I wanted.
732,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"AMAZING, YOU NEED THESE These are AMAZING!!!!!!! I hate when things cling to me or look too baggy and I honestly did not think that with these joggers. Yes, the material is more like an active legging material instead of sweatpants but that makes them great for working out!!! They are light instead of heavy and so incredibly soft. I have already sent the link to friends and family because they‚Äôre too good to keep to myself. GET THEM!!! I‚Äôm only 4‚Äô11‚Äù and got a large and they didn‚Äôt look too baggy or clingy or anything on me, seriously buy them!!"
733,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Everyone should have a go-to hoodie in their repertoire. My last doppelganger of this hoodie lasted me 3 years and I wore it whenever the weather deemed fit. Finally faded, shrunk and with a ripped pocket, my cheap behind decided to grab a new one. Glad I did. This thing is to me what a comfy set of PJs might be to someone else. With summer approaching I'll have to hang it up and show off my fat belly but I look forward to our many days together when fall arrives again. Def worth the price and fits a bit baggy at first but after a few washes(and dries, which I'm avoiding at all costs cos I love it a little loose on me) it should fit a tad snugger on you."
734,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love it! Loved the dress for the holidays
735,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Wash it on hot if it's too big I bought this sweater to go under a jacket and although it was comfortable it was somewhat large. Especially in the stomach area. I washed it on hot and it shrunk down so I recommend anyone that buys this sweater washes it on hot if it comes too big, now it fits better"
736,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great shirt I would buy this again
737,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love this This is a great summer dress, nice and flowy/airy. Plus, in the hot humid heat, the design will hide any sweat marks you might get. Love the style and have bought multiple! :)"
738,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Review from a small guy My dimensions are 5' 7"" 130lbs slim athletic build.<br /><br />I was looking for an affordable tank top to wear for indoor rock climbing. I've never considered wearing a tank top before now but I thought I'd try it.<br />These fit pretty loose on me, but not really noticeably. I just hoped the xs would be a little more fitted. If I had a beer belly, I guess I would appreciate the extra material used to make these. As someone else mentioned, it's a basketball jersey type of material, so it's a bit see through, but not bad. It'll be really breathable, and a little stretchy.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not super stoked about the fit, but for the money, I can't complain too much."
739,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great quality for the price No complaints
740,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Quality deteriorates every time I buy I have a couple pairs of these in different colours. The first ones I bought are my favourite clothing. This last pair are the exact same as the first pair... and I don't really want to wear them. They're thinner and scratchier, fit differently, there's a hole in the pocket.<br /><br />If these had been the very first pair I'd gotten, I'd've never bought them again.<br /><br />I will have my eye out for different sweats from now on. I'm disappointed. I thought I had found something I could just keep buying. (I had secret plans of filling my wardrobe with many of the colours and wearing them all the time - since that's what I always wind up doing ayway.)<br /><br />P.S. They're still flattering, but I don't think that will last long with much wear, given how thin they are."
741,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"roly poly Great for a workout, I bought it because I have to wear a tank under my scrubs. It keeps rolling up not matter what I do. I‚Äôm a caregiver so I can‚Äôt be constantly unrolling my undershirt. Otherwise I love them."
742,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Good quality Surprised at the quality for the price. These do not ride up, fit very well and do not shrink after drying. I will be ordering more!!"
743,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Material is soft and comfortable Fit and quality exceptional!  I will buy more.
744,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Love it, great price and fast shipping Love it ,great price  and fast shipping"
745,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Awesome The fit
746,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Great, but short torso I've been wearing these for a few weeks now as a base layer.  They work great and I like them.  I'm 5'8&#34; and 126lbs and got a small.  The only part I'm not one hundred percent happy with is the torso area.  I was going for a compression shirt and it all is good except for this torso area is not as tight as I would have thought it could be.  Also the length of the torso is maybe normal.  It goes to the top of my jeans.  I would have preferred a longer torso so I could wear it past my waist.  If I tuck it in it stays, but the back will eventually come out.  So great shirts overall.  It's hard to find a shirt that fits just right since we all have different body types."
747,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great fit It fit great and as expected
748,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars NICE
749,5,B09M6X79V9,1,The fit This item fits perfectly and it being black with a splash of color is slimming
750,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Arrived Stained Great fit & colors but the yellow tank was next to the red tank when packaged and the dye from the red tank bled onto the yellow tank. I‚Äôve tried everything to try to remove the color bleed because I didn‚Äôt want to deal with a return but have been unsuccessful. Buyers beware if you order the yellow/red/blue pack. Colors are beautiful, fit is perfect (for reference I ordered a size small and I‚Äôm 32DD) I wear for yoga & boot camp so I want a snug fit when inverted."
751,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Hooded Zip-up! Great fit!  It was exactly what we were looking for!
752,4,B09M6X79V9,1,There thin and I was sent a size large instead of small Not bad but they sent me the wrong size and the gray doesn't look like the picture. There also pretty thin.
753,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,RUSSELL SWEATS ARE WONDERFUL RUSSELL SWEATS ARE WONDERFUL but run at least one size larger than say Jerzees or Hanes.
754,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love it Very pretty as expected
755,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Buy!! Bought it to cut the sleeves off to use as a paint shirt, and hated to do it because the material was so nice. Oh well, the paint shirt is really nice too."
756,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweat shirt Replaced an older one very comterable
757,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Four Stars Size runs true. Well made for the price.  Cute dress
758,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Very comfortable. I had a double mastectomy a couple of months ago and I am suppose to use a compression bra which is very uncomfortable. I purchased the compression tank tops because they are more comfortable than wearing a compression bra.<br /><br />I've purchased this same tank tops twice and in different colors. As I improve after my surgery I will buy more again. I just love them, they really look beautiful and they feel great against your skin. They make me feel good!"
759,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect I like the fit
760,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Looks good fits good I have six of these and they all fit perfectly. Price is 100% worth it.
761,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Good buy I might have finally found a dress that I like from Amazon that is how I expected to fit and flow at the right size I wear and the right material as my other maxi dresses.  I would buy more, but all were double the price of this one.  Got lucky on a good deal with this one.  I‚Äôm going to wait for the others to go on  sale so I can buy more."
762,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Bust a bit snug but fit. Well made and very comfortable. Well made. True to size. Perfect pocket placement.
763,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Nice back. Wow, I need to get into better shape before I wear this to a gym. Haha."
764,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars Cutest dress ever!!
765,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Love it! Fits me just right, and is surprisingly comfortable. The material hangs nicely and doesn't feel cheap. This is going to be a go-to for me this summer! The color in the black one is more noticeable in person. I got medium and I'm 5'8"" 150lbs with smallish assets."
766,5,B076QD9NP1,1,She Loves It!! Thank You!! She Loves It !! Thank You !!

772,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Comfortable and flattering. Love the color I chose too! Love the color, fit, and style! Great buy for a great price."
773,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Nice workout shirt I actually bought these to wear under my scrubs, and since I like my under scrubs to fit tight these worked great. I wouldn‚Äôt describe this as a true compression shirt though, just form fitting. It is also thin so it may not keep you warm if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for."
774,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"GREAT JACKET I USE IT TO GO TO THE GYM IN COLD DAYS,  AND FOR ME WORKS FINE. THE JACKET HAS EXCELLENT QUALITY."
775,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Fit perfect I am very satisfied with this purchase.
776,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"My favorite joggers! Fit is good, stretch is good, true to size, love the fabric! And pockets, did I mention pockets?"
777,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Perfect
778,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Fits skin tight - order bigger if you want a looser fit
779,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Comfortable Compression Shirts This is the perfect compression shirt for me, I love the 3 different colors.  These do run small.  I returned them and reordered a larger size."
780,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Comfortable I used it for working out. It is very comfortable and fits well.

787,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Perfect fit This dress fits perfect, very flattering and lightweight"
788,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love them These are the best!  I love them. I get compliments at the gym and when I go out. There's very flattering and fitting..
789,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,It‚Äôs a great s west shirt Great all around sweat shirt
790,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I have been in search of the perfect hoodie and I think I found it. As someone who is 6'2, 210lbs it's hard for me to find clothing that doesn't fit me like a crop top after the first wash and dry but this product has definitely held up. It has a spacious fit without feeling too baggy  and the length is on point. Will definitely be purchasing more Russell Athletics product soon."
791,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Squat proof! Great for the price. Ran a tad small but still comfy!
792,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Best crewneck! Love this crewneck and the quality of sweatshirt is more than asking price. If you want oversized feel order size up. Not stuff and not flimsy. Able to layer. Would be perfect for personalizing too.
793,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Rides up. I have to keep pulling it down, but the are very comfortable"
794,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Cute and versatile My daughter loves this dress. It's great for a swim suit cover-up too!

797,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love them. Live in them now Love them.  Live in them now.
798,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Warm and beautiful wash after wash. My husband loves this Russell Athletic Dri Power Fleece. In fact I have bought him the same sweatshirt in multiple colors. The fabric is thick and warm and stands up beautifully wash after wash. He is typically not a fan of long sleeves even in the dead of a midwestern winter, but he says these are very comfortable. I was concerned because he usually takes a tall size, but this fleece runs a little large and long so the regular size was perfect."
799,5,B009R09Z8W,1,awesome hoodie! Fits just as expected. Feels nice and warm and the colors are bright and vibrant.
800,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great for workouts My son asked for these to wear to the gym. He‚Äôs recently started lifting weights and this shirt is perfect. Doesn‚Äôt bind him and has no sleeves to aggravate him
801,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Great buy! Love the pants, they fit as expected, delivery was fast and the product is of good quality. Both were washed before wearing and no noticeable shrinkage was observed. At first these appeared to be thinner than a normal thick sweat pant however, they are so warm and lightweight, the fabric is great. It is nice to find a pair of sweats that don't shrink in length and are a good length to begin with, they fit my wife who is 5'8 perfectly. Would definitely buy these again."
802,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Highly recommend! Design is a little different but it's my bright even after many washes. It's super think and comfy :)
803,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,So comfortable very loose and comfortable fit. Perfect for a summer day.
804,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"A wardrobe staple I get compliments on this dress every time I wear it. I dress for efficiency and being comfortable, so it‚Äôs a plus when this is also stylish. I use this dress as a nightgown or for going out to pick up kids and errands. For what I paid for it and how many hundred of times I‚Äôve worn it, it‚Äôs a purchase I don‚Äôt regret."
805,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Color was perfect
806,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Runs small This item is an unbreathable fabric that doesn‚Äôt have much stretch to it.<br />I wear the RBX brand in a M, this was a large and too tight. Nice colors choices.<br />I‚Äôll return and keep looking."
807,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,do not walk RUN ordering leggings off amazon have been the best success i‚Äôve had ! these leggings do not disappoint !!! size small i could have done an xs for more compression but these are so flattering and buttery soft ! just like the gum shark vital seamless but for half the price !! how could you go wrong !!
808,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Love it Ware it to work every day
809,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Pretty good Good job
810,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars Soft and fits great. Really cute!
811,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Order size up I‚Äôm normally large in tops. The size chart recommended XL and I ordered a size up, so XXL. It fit snug but loose enough to wear as a shirt by itself. If you want traditional dry fit, under armor type layering, order based on their size chart. Thick material, love the shirts!"
812,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Would reorder A great under layer for cold Michigan days.  Would reorder again.
813,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Preferable to my Gymsharks Just got the black and they look and fit exactly like my Gymsharks. The black has the same compression as the Gymsharks too. I also have these in the marine blue, gray, and green marl and they are my favorite of all my leggings. The colors have a bit less compression and are softer, which I prefer. Overall I find myself choosing these over and over instead of my Gymsharks!"
814,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Incredibly comfy These joggers are amazing! They have quickly become my favorite pants. They‚Äôre great as loungewear or for working out! I got the black and grey tie dye print, and it‚Äôs so cute! In love with these pants and buying more! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, a size 14-16 and I got the XXL and they‚Äôre not too tight or too loose and fit perfectly."
815,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Amazingüôåüòç This hoodie is one of the best hoodies I've ordered from Amazon. It's so comfortable and the inside is really soft and it's not thin at all. Your definitely getting what you pay for. I'm in love ‚ù§. 100% recommend üòÅüëç

820,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good quality! I love this jacket.  It‚Äôs just the right weight!
821,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable This sweatshirt was exactly what I had expected.  Russell makes a good quality shirt.  The sizing is accurate ( medium for 5'8"" & 155 lbs.) and it is quite comfortable.  I think they should lose the neck collar tags, as they frequently stick up.  The price is good for what you receive and the color was true."
822,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Regular white undershirts comfortable fit real nice in the lint I will order some more very happy I was looking for a undershirt to replace the Regular white undershirts comfortable fit real nice in the lint I will order some more very happy

832,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Cute Cute Cute and soooo COOL Very, very cute!  I am a tad below 5'5&#34; and the dress is a little long on me in the back. However, I did let the adjustable straps down almost all the way.  There is quite a bit of adjustability in the straps, which is an excellent feature for me.  I read all the reviews and ordered the large, although  usually like an XL in this type of dress.  The large size fit great!"

Not too hot, not too cold in them. Perfect for the money! Immediately bought a 2nd pair and waiting on a specific color to come in stock for another pair. Highly recommend."
839,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Beautiful üòç I really like the feel of the dress. And the snow leopard print is beautiful.

849,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,Best thing ever These pants are one of my faves. I like how the material is still legging spandex material but it has a jogger fit. It runs to size. I'm 125 and I got a small and it stills fits baggy in the right areas. Would so buy AGAIN!

860,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice, just way too small The quality of this underwear is good, material stretches out and is comfy. Be aware size is way too small. I am regularly a M sometimes L, and this time I got XL which barely fits me. I had to return the items 2 times (at no cost) until I got the right size, but in the meantime I waited longer than expected."
861,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"What a value! It fits me perfect (I'm 6'1&#34;, 250lbs) and is warm but not too warm. Hood isn't too big and the front &#34;pouch&#34; pocket is nice."

878,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,A little short but super soft I wanted to love these joggers on reading reviews but they are just too short. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù . They are super soft and fit slightly loose in the leg .
879,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfortable base layer for under workout tanks Compression? Not so much. Comfortable? Definitely. Would recommend. I ordered a medium and it fit snug and is stretchy.
880,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"love these! If you are hippie order a larger size...they are not baggie, I am thin so there good ...but my granddaughter I ordered a bigger size cuz she's hippie, she loved them too, fun colors!"

885,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Very soft The design was actually better than expect--I ordered the gray camo but there are hints of green in design.  The material is very soft, lightweight and fits as expected."

887,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Amazing dresse Super
888,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Very comfortable Very nice fabric and fit. I generally wear a small/medium top. 130lbs, 5'2"", fit but not athletic build. I purchased a medium desiring a more loose fit and arm exposure. Great soft fabric. Runs larger than your regular size"
889,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Favorite layer to wear when it‚Äôs cold I have purchased these tops in multiple color and I wear one every morning when I walk my dogs. Love the v-neck because it‚Äôs high enough I don‚Äôt feel exposed. Fits true to size 5‚Äô5‚Äù 155lbs.
890,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Absolutely beautiful! This is a beautiful dress!  I ordered a medium it‚Äôs soft and flows right at my ankle. I really didn‚Äôt expect to get such great quality. It fits as if it was tailored just for me. I definitely will be ordering another in a different color.  I bought the red one which goes great with my skin color ( Native American) it would be beautiful on any woman. Best choice I‚Äôve made this year.
891,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"comfortable, fits as expected Warm, comfortable, fits as expected.  Not a lot to argue with, and the price was right.  If I have any negatives after I've washed it, I'll add them in later."
892,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Perfect summer dress Very  flattering. Absolutely love this dress. Was hard to tell when I ordered it if I would like the pattern‚Äîit‚Äôs great! Wore this to a summer wedding reception‚Äîit was perfect.
893,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,The best sweatshirts to buy!!! I really like the sweatshirts I got.
894,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Love the fit! Very comfortable and colors are nice. Good quality.
895,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,I like my top for the gym Since I've started wearing it and still going to the gym I've lost some girth so its beginning to hang. I would buy again.
896,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Good quality Great workout shirt for the price. I would say the sizing is correct. I ordered a small worried about and extra small being too tight but the small was a little baggy. Still fits fine though. Quality is good for the price.
897,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Sooo cute and comfy for summer! Perfect fit!
898,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Comfortable, warm and cozy!!! Comfortable, warm and cozy!  My wife loves this hoodie!!  She normally wears a 3X in shirts, so I bought a 4X hoodie.  I figured she would have some bulk from the shirt underneath, etc.  Or possibly just want a little more room for comfort sake.  Apparently I figured right.  The hoodie fit perfectly as expected for a 4X and provided the necessary tummy coverage (since the fit is a bit longer) as I hoped it would!!  Great product!!!"
899,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good quality Holding up well so far.  Bought for 6'3"" son and the length is good.  Thicker than I was expecting but that is a good thing."
900,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great material and does hold after many washes so its ... Great material and does hold after many washes so its a good product, but it does run a little big."
901,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Very comfortable! I was looking for a ton of compression due to having recent tummy tuck surgery. I would describe these as moderately light compression, but they are very comfortable & I like them."
902,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Excellent customer service! Update: Umm! Can I just say THE best customer service ever?! I wrote a review about a pair of two I purchased having a messed up seam and they contacted me and offered to replace them!!! I didn‚Äôt have to do anything. I got the replacement pair today and they‚Äôre perfect! Not a single flaw on them. They‚Äôre super comfy and stretchy and now are my favorite leggings. Thank you so much for being so great, Aoxjox!! Planning on buying all the colors!!<br /><br />Original review: I bought the steel blue vital seamless leggings first. They are pretty amazing! Stretchy, comfy, looked so good on. Then I bought a second pair in dusky pink a week later. The color was exactly like the picture and I loved them! But the pink ones had a messy seam stitch in the thigh and what looked to be a small tear/run where the crotch meets the bum seam. When stretches slightly you can see through that spot. I feel like after a couple workouts, the pink ones will give out and tear open. Still loving my blue ones. I wish my pink ones worked out. I really wanted to buy all the colors. Returning the pink ones for now but my size is sold out to have them replaced. Super sad!"
903,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Nice stretch, but too short. Good quality with a nice stretch, a little thin. Not quite long enough which is ultimately why I returned them."
904,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cute dress Cute halter dress that ties at the shoulder. The colors are very nice. It was slightly longer than I had expected and the material is fairly thin but not see-through. Cute dress for a Sunday lunch, etc."
905,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Quality This was the 2nd dress I ordered. My blue and white polka dot was grand and so I decided to do a replay with the red and white polka dot dress.<br />I have received over 6 compliments on these dresses. I love the pockets and the adjustable straps. I got caught in torrential rain one day and simple hung the dress to drip dry! PERFECT outcome!<br />Thank you!!!
906,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars The material is a little thin but it's good for the price
907,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Blue eyed grandson liked it Color was a little too bright. Will dull with washes. Good quality material. Fits well.

913,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good purchase
914,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Gorgeous dress I just received this and am beyond pleased! I am a very short person, barely 5 feet tall but have a full figure with a larger bust (40D). I don‚Äôt like anything tight. I bought the large and it fits perfectly - I will wear a sports type bra underneath - and I can just knot up the bottom so that I don‚Äôt trip. The pockets are very handy and because it has adjustable straps, they aren‚Äôt too terribly low on me. The fabric is a nice smooth lightweight rayon so I will wash with cold and hang dry.<br />I always read reviews to try and decipher what size to get so I hope that this one helps!"
915,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"I like them... Very comfortable, seam was a lil off going down the legs, kinda like a ross reject but it's not horrible"

918,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great purchase !! Will order again Great fit!!! Love these shirts I am a 32D usually a size small but the medium fits great. Not super tight but fitted. If you want a very snug compression top you should order your usual size... I like the medium though!!
919,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Would reccomend Great materials and fit
920,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Comfortable Love these joggers, probably have a pair in every color. The material could be better, noticed some areas on the bottom of pants on all of my joggers in the same area."
921,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Good for workouts Good for workouts but not as undershirts. They feel like under armor shirts but less constricting. And they have a slight shene to them
922,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Five Stars Love these tops to work out in and wear under my clothes , bery comfortable"
923,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Love it! Bought one to try out this style of shirt for my workouts. I‚Äôll be back for more colors!

929,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Comfy Comfy and love the pockets.  First one I bought was different color and ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù suggested small for me but it was a little tight around the breast area.  (I am 36 DD) so this time around I purchased medium and it fit perfectly.
930,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Fit amazing The material is soft and non irritating, it fits perfectly and holds without a bra."
931,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good quality These are comfy ,"
932,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Dupe for gym shark I LOVE THESE! if you‚Äôre looking for a cheaper alternative or a dupe to gym shark, this is your best bet. I spent $60 on gym shark leggings, and they were extremely hard to get into. The material on these are very good quality, they are breathable and easy to maneuver in. It has small detailing around the legs and butt to help accentuate your figure. However, the compression isn‚Äôt really present in the fupa region so beware if you have a heavy lunch. But it‚Äôs not too noticeable, the compression in the legs are just right. No panty lines, or camel toes here! Will definitely buy againüí™üèº"
933,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,im sure its fine its a gift
934,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Like the fit I like the way they fit. The length is great. Not to short. Material is different. Not soft. A little rough. I was going to buy a couple more but decided the fabric wasn‚Äôt what I thought it would be.

938,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,The Brand I Trust The Russell Athletic brand is the brand I trust. I would not buy any other brand of sweats because this product is so durable.
939,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Flattering cut Very soft and nice flattering cut.

950,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Fit Nice fit and keeps you warm on cold days!
951,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Solid Choice for a Sweat Shirt I like the material ... comfortable and heavy.
952,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Careful with the sizes but otherwise, the shirts are great! The shirts are absolutely great and have a great look but they aren't as stretchy as some other brands. However, the price for the three of them is definitely a steal! I'm in a stage in my life where I can juggle between a medium and a large because of my physique and my height but I definitely ordered a size too small. Medium size isn't a bad fit but I should've gone with the large option. If you know for a fact that you are a certain size then definitely choose that option but if you also struggle with being able to juggle between two different sizes, choose the larger option. As for quality of the material, they have been doing well so far and I don't expect any tears in these any time soon but if they do (keep in mind this could also be due to the fact that I ordered a size smaller), I will definitely update this review as I'm sure any one person would want to have workout shirts last."
953,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good comfortable basic sweatshirt Large size fit well - not to sloppy or too tight.  I've worn it for a few days now, and it seems to hold up well - no stretching.  I haven't washed it yet, so we'll see."
954,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great fit Great workout tops.
955,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Cool in Summer and Warm in Winter This product is great!! Fits me like a glove. Keeps me warm in winter but also cool in summer. I love these so much that I ordered more and more and....
956,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Good product! Comfortable and true to size!
957,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Four Stars I like the quality, just fits more tight then I expected."
958,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"I love the material of this product and you can't beat ... I love the material of this product and you can't beat the price.  The only tricky part is figuring out your size and how it fits.  I like that it's fitted, but the length of the shirt down my torso was a little short.  For example, when I raise my hands above my head to reach for something, it rides up and a little of my tummy is exposed.  I normally wear a US size L if it is women's sizing.  If adult sizing, a medium and sometimes small if I like it more fitted.  I ordered the US XL size for this shirt and I think next time I'd go for the XXL if they have one.<br /><br />I use mines for playing tennis in the sun as it wicks moisture from my skin as well as gives me some sun protection without having to wear sunscreen on my arms.  I also use the sleeves to wipe the sweat from my forehead and it evaporates from the material very quickly.  I am happy with my purchase and I would order it again if they have an XXL size."
959,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Could size down on fit. Really stretchy so you could size down!
960,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Bought this for my husband and he loves it.

964,5,B09M6X79V9,1,top great.
965,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Just as good as the other products I've purchased from Neleus I decided to buy this three pack of muscle tanks with a hoodie because one of my friends sweats a lot. Nothing is worse than having someone else's sweat on the back of your head. In a way, this purchase was more for my friend than me. This is also the fourth time I've purchased clothing from Neleus. I hope this brand continues to grow because the deals they give can't be beat."
966,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Amazingly comfortable foodie! Im 6 feet tall, 180lbs, and Medium size fits perfectly. This foodies are 100 times better than ones by Uniqlo."
967,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great! Fits great and great quality! The shipping was unbelievably fast. I am very happy with this purchase!
968,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good One High quality hoodie, thick and well made."

971,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Perfect workout tank Bought these for my husband and a he loves them. He says they wick the sweat just right and they are the perfect workout shirt. He wants more of them.
972,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,HAVE TO BUY!!!!!!! ok no joke these are hands down the absolute best leggings I have ever owned! I am going to purchase every single color they have! For reference Im 5'2 123 lbs and the XS is perfect!
973,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Awesome shirts I wanted to be sure before writing this review.<br />Before buying I read a bunch of reviews about sizes to make sure I got the correct size. Some reviews were misleading. I have a slightly larger chest and normally take a large in regular T-shirts and wanted these shirts to be snug as I planned to use them as an undershirt. Being these are compression I decided to go 1 size bigger and got an extra large. They fit perfectly, slightly tighter around the chest, feel great against my skin and look amazing. I can also use these as a tank top. So if you want them to be snug go 1 size bigger. If you want tight compression then get your normal size. The only bad thing I can say is they aren't tagless. But the tag is pretty small and seems to stay tucked in. If they they were tagless then I would definitely give 5 stars."
974,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Nice My son loves these. Fits a tad bit bigger than expected, but he like things a lil snug"

982,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Good product for the price, fits comfortably Decent moisture wicking, comfortable not necessarily compression fit, good product for the price."
983,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Fits perfect. Great material. Not the courser cheaper cotton of some hoodies. Very soft. Good color.
984,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Buy these! I received a black small with the contour and cut outs in the back of the thighs and they are so flattering and squat proof!  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 135 and a small was a perfect fit!  Customer service was A+
985,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good value and looks good. I'm 6 foot, 155 lbs and the small fit well. I purposely went down a size and am glad I did, it still had some flow like in the photos while not being too baggy. Like some of the other reviewers I found some colors are slightly different material than others - at first I got the black white and grey but returned those because the white and black were scratchy (though the grey was amazingly soft). Then I tried the black grey and blue and for some reason all three were soft this time, so I'm happy."
986,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Exelente calidad Me encant√≥ muy buena calidad , la hab√≠a comprado para mi hijo, a √®l le encant√≥ tambien"
987,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Love the product Love the product. It is somewhat thin compared to other hoodies I own however this hoodie is still good for keeping you warm! Will definitely be buying more in different colors.
988,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,But them NOW If you‚Äôre thinking about getting them just do it. True to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 120lbs and a small fits perfect! I have thicker thighs and a smaller waist and it‚Äôs so hard to find joggers that don‚Äôt look like leggings or sag when I put my phone in my pocket. These are absolutely perfect! They also really do repel dog hair idk how!! The fabric is like a mixture of align leggings and soccer joggers? Silky but smooth and stretchy. I just wore them on a trip where I flew 3 legs there and back and they were perfect and comfortable! As soon as I got them I ordered another pair in a different color. I‚Äôve been on the hunt for the perfect joggers for so long and these are definitely them!!
989,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great for a nightgown This dress makes for a comfortable nightgown, but too low cut to wear out as a dress<br />It has pockets"

994,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Buy them... Dance Teacher - I own these joggers in many colors I teach dance classes 5 days a week so I wear a ton of athletic wear. I adore these joggers! They are so comfortable, NOT sheer (AMEN), have pockets and are very flattering. Sizing you could probably fit in multiple sizes. I buy a medium and that is pretty typical for most leggings I would wear. The price point is perfect. I own these in like 4 colors now I believe. 10/10 Recommend these pants ... Can't seem to find any other photos of me wearing them haha"
995,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Love the fit I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 157 pounds toned. I ordered an xl originally and it was so big. I Didn‚Äôt return the item but  will find someone to give it too. I then ordered a medium and it fit really good. Would purchase again.
996,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Simple Comfy Quality This dress is every bit the same as the pics, I‚Äôm much larger than the model but my size fits me the same way it fit on her. It‚Äôs very soft. Wrinkles easy (being seated for awhile), but the wrinkles fall out in no time. Very comfortable, soft material. I could wear this everyday. You can dress it up or down, I was really apprehensive about it but I am glad I got it."

All I can say is, this is very comfortable and fits nice. This has excellent build quality and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a comfy and cheap sweater. The only con is the arm sleeves may be a little fat but I ordered a large, so you might like it!"

She is short 4‚Äô11 and we were afraid the dress would be to long but it was perfect. She looks so cute, had many compliments and she felt amazing. Now she is asking me to get her the other colors hahahaha"
1013,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Love the fit I love the fit of the shirt. Spandex material fits comfortably.
1014,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Solid quality product at price point A workout buddy suggested these to me, and I have to say he was right. I went with XL as buddy mentioned they fit a bit tight, and it is perfect. I am 5'11"" x 180lbs - workout quite a bit. I feel the fit at the chest, but it isn't bad or uncomfortable. Hood is great for running in a drizzle. The 3 pack at this cost can't be beat."
1015,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Good item Good item
1016,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"I feel pretty I love this sun dress, I feel sexy in it!!! Shows off my tan"

1019,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great garment This are hard to find with this great quality
1020,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I would definitely buy more again It holds it shape to the body and is breathable and just over all a good product
1021,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"great value and fit this is our go to brand,byou can count on the fit"
1022,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Very tight fitting I love these!  I got a small because I like things to hug my body and it‚Äôs for under my scrubs so it‚Äôs a perfect fit. Would recommend if your layering
1023,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Hard to find in stores I have found Russell sweatshirts and tees to be the very best value, in terms of fit and looks"
1024,5,B009R09Z8W,1,It‚Äôs a terrific hoodie My granddaughter loves everything about it.
1025,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Curvy girl approved I love these joggers. They are perfect for working out. Not too lose but comfortable.<br />I wear a 10-12 and bought a large. I want another pair!
1026,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Born Muy bien
1027,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Yaasss queen These leggings are *chefs kiss*, super flattering, stretchy, and comfortable. These leggings do not fall down and you cannot see through them. 10/10!!"
1028,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Keeps you dry I use it as an under shirt for work. It keeps me comfortable.
1029,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Not what I was expecting! 2/15/2017:  Update<br />This seller reached out to me after I left a review stating it wasn't what I expected as far as the large polka dots.<br />This dress is comfortable and I am able to dress it up or dress it down.  The dots are larger then expected, but other then that, thank you for this considerate seller who reached out to me to make sure I was happy with the product.  I will be purchasing from this seller again.<br /><br />A lot of material that feels nice on and love that there are pockets.  However, what's advertised is much much  smaller polka dots. What I received were big polka dots on a black background.  Ugh!!!!!!!"
1030,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great for the price! For the cost you're not going to find a much better deal. The only issues I can speak of is the small was slightly too tight in the chest but the medium's length was just a little too long (note: your body type may fit differently as I have rather developed chest) . But its still my go to tank for the gym.
1031,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Just go for it! They fit super well. I love how my figure looks in them. Another plus side is that cat hair doesn't stick as well. I'm about to buy another pair.
1032,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Not for large breasted women Lovely dress - comfortable lightweight fabric. It was too tight across the bust but would have been too big everywhere else if I went up a side. If you're large breasted it's probably not for you.
1033,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great Joggers!! Was worried these would be to long as I am very petite, they fit perfect in the length. Material is very soft and comfortable."
1034,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great I work out 6 days a week, liked them well enough to order another 3 pack to make a full set."
1035,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice fit - good quality It's just as I expected.
1036,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Petites don‚Äôt bat an eye. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 2‚Äùcan wear them with ease. Fantastic! Highly recommend!
1037,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits well Great fit
1038,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Good material Was a little hesitant at first but it was amazing. Bought as a Christmas gift for a friend and he loved it! The purple was vibrant but soft
1039,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"I Love My New Tanktops, Thank You Neleus! I will be buying these as long as they are manufactured.  I am 5'2 and 100 lbs.  I lead a active lifestyle and wanted more plain black tank tops for my workouts, hiking trips, and all other adventures.  I wanted a material that was not too thick or stiff but was form fitting.  I wanted it to have a feminine cut.  I tried two other brands of tank top on Amazon and kept getting either bizarre fits or weirdly thick material.  These are the winner!  Thank you Neleus for making some a phenomenal tank top, and I will be ordering more in the future!<br /><br />Important FAQ Answers:<br />- Since purchasing I have worn the heck out of these.  I use them as a base layer when horseback riding, I workout in them daily, and I have worn them under nice sweaters as added warmth.  They have shown no signs of wear and I have not shown them any special treatment...at all, maybe the opposite?<br />-There is not a bra liner, cami, insert.  I prefer this, but there you go.<br />-The material is like that of some very high quality workout tops I bought in the past that are $16 each.  It does wick sweat away from my body, does not retain any odor, and moves with my body.<br />-These are long enough that they do not ride up when stretching upward or doing wonky movements but not so long that they go to my tush.  Just the right length, but I know that will vary for folks of different body types. I am fairly even proportioned so if you have a long torso these may not be in your favor.<br />-The neckline is modest<br />-Yes I strongly recommend them!"
1040,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfortable These are the most comfortable sweatpants I have had in a long time!
1041,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable I‚Äôm not sure I would consider these compression tanks, but I kept them because they fit and they‚Äôre pretty comfortable."
1042,4,B076QD9NP1,1,"Still looks the same in 2023 as it did in 2016 when purchased (Update: Purchased 2016, it's now 2023 and the dress still looks the same. It went through 2 kids, thousands of washes and is now in a keepsake box)<br /><br />Relieved when I finally received this dress today and saw it in person. There are many different companies on Amazon selling this dress with reviews showing pictures of entirely different dresses or hideous copies being mailed to them instead. Happily, I received the exact dress shown for sale.<br />The dress has images of multiple different cats in a rainbow of different very bright, vibrant colors printed onto the fabric. The colors are not neons but they are bright for sure. The fabric is a very thin, silky material and feels very similar to the material they use to make little girls nightgowns with. According to the tag it is 100% polyester. It comes with no real washing instructions so it will be interesting to see how it holds up to cleanings over time. I guess I'll just wash it on gentle with cold water and hang dry to be safe.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- crisp, bright, vibrant colors and images exactly as pictured<br />- thin, silky feeling material perfect for warm weather<br />- decently priced now that they lowered it to $16.<br />-to my inexperienced eye, it appears to be made well as all the stitches are perfectly uniformed. none are sloppy, uneven, there are no loose threads, etc.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- 100% polyester which is highly flammable and the label even states &quot;keep away from fire&quot;<br />-There are no directions on how to clean it. Only a few images which do not help me much, although I could be a complete moron. The images are: a bucket of liquid  with '30' in the liquid. A crossed out triangle. An iron. And a crossed out circle. I do not know what the triangle and circle mean so clearer directions would've been nice.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the dress as it is hard to find such colorful, cute, cat printed dresses for my daughter and I would purchase this dress again<br /><br />(Close up photos of fabric show the colors exactly as they appear in my brightly lit living room)"

1044,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"I'm satisfied with that fit and the material is light and ... I prefer a relatively loose fit, so I usually order a M/L at 5'5 and weighing 150lbs. But I ordered a XXL in these shirts to get the loose fit I wanted. I'm satisfied with that fit and the material is light and stretchy to accommodate intense workouts."

1055,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Softest pants ever! OMG these are my new favorite everyday pants. I can‚Äôt even explain how incredibly soft these truly are. They have just enough elasticity to not dig into your tummy, but not so much that they will stretch with wear. They are warm in the Michigan weather, but still comfortable on the random warmer days. These pants are a must buy!"
1056,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Warm and comfy I'm a petite woman buying a men's size large.  It fits exactly the way I want it to......tunic like.  These hold up well, they wash and dry well and they are warm.  I already have 4 of them and will buy more in the future."
1057,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable and well made I have been buying Russell for many years because they are comfortable and well made, having durable material and seams. They are also rather generously cut so the bottom hem of the tops always sit well below the top of your pants--with my build there are 8 inches of overlap.  The ones I just bought are no exception."
1058,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars very good buy

1062,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Loose in chest The chest was less supportive then what I would like but I can still get away without a bra. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äô‚Äô 34DD 160 very curvy. Nice material. Glad I got it for my vacation
1063,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Lovely material, soft and flowing I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 149 lbs. I usually wear a Medium or a 10. I bought this in a Medium and it fits beautifully. The color is a vibrant cool red (as opposed to a warm red) with white polka dots. The material is soft and flowing, not see through. It comes to just above the floor in bare feet but right about my ankles with 3‚Äù heels. The straps are adjustable and it has pockets on both sides. I liked it both loose and flowing or with a belt. This dress can be dressed up with heels and a belt or casual with flats. It would also be fun over a bathing suit. I would definitely purchase this style again."
1064,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Smooth! Fit great and I'm a big dude.  6ft 315.

1078,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Good! They weren‚Äôt quite the material I expected, I was thinking something a little more cottony (these are literally a legging material). But I actually kind of like it because I don‚Äôt own any joggers like them and they‚Äôre super comfortable."

1085,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Okay I got a medium and it is a bigger than I would have liked but it does have breathable room. I tried the small and that was tight on my legs. I am 5""6"" 134lbs and I got a medium. Wouldn't buy another pair"

1090,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Love these They are my favorite sweat pants. I wear them all the time.  They are a good, durable material"
1091,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Material is thicker than others out there. Was used as a Halloween costume of Theodore.  Was thicker than others i ordered fabric and cut was as expected.
1092,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Very nice dress I really like this dress. It fits well. It looks good on or with a denim jacket. I dont always feel comfortable in a dress but this one is nice.  The material is perfect as well. 10/10.
1093,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Runs large. Great sweatshirt but runs quite large.
1094,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Very nice t shirt
1095,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Low in the back These sweats are super comfy.  My only complaint is that they are low in the back and I wear briefs that go to my belly button.  I‚Äôm short so I‚Äôm guessing these are supposed to fit like hipsters which I know a lot of ladies like so I‚Äôm sure it just isn‚Äôt the right fit for me.  If they were a few inches higher in the back I would love these.  I feel like I constantly have to grab at these and I can‚Äôt bend over.  These are most definitely house pants as I could never wear these out.
1096,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Amazing look, feel, and quality I love the style and the lettering in the  back. Neulus makes some great great quality items. I own their compression shorts, running pants, now the dry fit shirts.<br /><br />The ONLY con is that I assumed the large would fit more snug. I'm afraid that going to medium might be too small."

1098,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"The purrfect dress for your little one. My daughter looks adorable in this dress! She gets a lot of compliments when she wears it. She also has the matching headband, which takes her look to the next level. It is easy to care for too. Which is fantastic!"
1099,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Would buy again! I'm 5'6, 140 pounds, and a 36D. I usually wear a US medium or I ordered the Asia 175-180, European large, US medium and it fit looser than expected. Didn't have any troubles with the length, like some others. Nice breathable material. Would order again!"
1100,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Perfect fit, nice feel Fits wonderfully and is very soft. Head hole is just the right size. Material is medium weight and great!"
1101,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable Very comfortable. It runs a tiny bit large as other buyers commented but that‚Äôs fine for me. Wash in cold and you‚Äôll be fine.
1102,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"It was great but you might wanna adjust some sizes I loved mostly everything about this, the only thing was the fitting because it was a bit too big but it was good still because it wasn't hugging my body"
1103,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Great buy I wish these were cotton. Overall This is a very good buy and I would recommend this to others
1104,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Lightweight, breathable and nice colors Was skeptical at first  , the colors are great, stays bright and doesn‚Äôt wrinkle up. The material is perfect , breathing and light. I could have done without the razor back but that‚Äôs fine , getting another pack for the summer"

1108,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweatshirt but it's so large Great sweatshirt but it's so large!!! I ordered a men's medium and it fit like a men's large! Be wary when ordering - would suggest getting a size smaller
1109,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect for my 11 year old son I used this to make a homemade Halloween costume and it was perfect.  It can also be used regularly since it is comfy and soft.
1110,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"I love it I love this dress, I only wish that it came in more colors. Do you have anything with that material and that fit? I would love to order more. The other two are okay I‚Äôm not nearly as happy with the fit as the one l love. Can you let me know if you have more like the dress that I‚Äôm crazy about?"
1111,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Fits as expected True to size, maybe slightly smaller. Light weight with decent stitching. Overall worth the money"

1158,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits just right! Fits just right!  Not too tight or loose.  Very satisfied!
1159,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Excellent! The black heather version is truly outstanding...fits better than the same sweatshirt in red and gray!  I like it so much, I immediately ordered a second one!"
1160,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great Around the House Pants Comfortable fit

1164,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Buena compra ! Qued√≥ perfecto a mi cuerpo.
1165,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Product came as advertised. Fit great and looks great !
1166,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Like the fabric, not the cut I bought one of these to try them out, and I was glad I did. The fabric is nice and light - perfect for working out, and the cutaways at the arm holes are really great (beats grungy T-shirt pits!). However, I decided I didn't like the high neckline in the front - I would have preferred something a bit more scooped out in front, as the front of the shirt by the neckline was drenched by the end of my workout. That could be my personal preference, though, so don't let it put you off! I'll keep wearing this shirt, but will order a different one next time."
1167,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Make sure to get the right size The product fit very well for my wife
1168,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Love them Light weight.  Comfortable material too. Allows for easy movement as well. Drys quickly.
1169,5,B0928FSGGD,1,definitely ordering more I fell in love the moment i put it on. Definitely ordering more!
1170,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Perfect dress We had an ice cream theme for my daughters birthday! This dress was gorgeous. It exceeded my expectation!!!
1171,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Basic polyester tank top‚Äôs. I purchased these for my husband because he likes this type of material to wear for undershirts. For work he wears a collared shirt, so the tank top is perfect underneath those as he is working. But when he is just wearing a regular T-shirt, the tank top cannot be worn underneath, because of how high the back of it comes up. So when he puts a T-shirt over this tank top, if you can see it around the back of the collar sticking out of the T-shirt and it just looks odd. Other than that issue, the material is exactly as described. The tank top was a perfect fit for him. For a reference, I got size extra large. He is 511, 185 lbs.<br />So if you want these to wear under your regular T-shirt, I would not recommend these. If you want to wear these as they are OR for under a collared shirt, I would recommend."
1172,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Very nice jacket for the price. Warm too for my husband who gets cold easily.
1173,5,B097RFTKJP,1,So cute and comfy! It‚Äôs super stretchy and soft the design compliments you Literally so cute and comfy! The black makes me feel skinny while the design highlights all the right places. Love it.
1174,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great workout shirts! Love these! Fit great, very comfortable! I wouldn't say they compress but maybe if you size down from your regular size they might compress. I bought what I usually am, a large."
1175,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,... have to say the cut on this dress is perfect. I love maxi dresses but they're so hard ... I'm six foot I have to say the cut on this dress is perfect. I love maxi dresses but they're so hard to find for my size height. I'm loving this maxi dress I can even wear a bra underneath LOL.
1176,5,B009R09Z8W,1,This thing is SO nice and cozy This thing is SO nice and cozy. I intentionally ordered a huge one so I could bundle myself up in it.
1177,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice ""fitted"" sweatshirt I absolutely loVe this brand, especially the dri-power fleece crewneck or hoodie in it.  They have these seams that go down the side front that almost give it that slightly, fitted look.  It's just a tad heavier, and price wise, more than a typical plain crewneck or hoodie (think Gildan or Jerzee), but quality-wise, it's bar none and worth the added moolah!"
1178,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Tight Not made for fat guys
1179,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,2xx It fit good. I am a plus size so i was very happy that is fit.
1180,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great tank tops These tanks are super soft and keep you cooler than other materials while you're active.
1181,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,It fit Like the fit.
1182,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"They don‚Äôt pill and are durable I love my tops but you do need a sports bra underneath them. Initially, I bought these tops thinking they would come with a shelf bra so I would only have to slip on the tank to work out. Not so. They are, however, great yoga tops! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 170 pounds, and 11 weeks postpartum. I got a small and wear them when I do yoga at the house."
1183,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Just as pictured Genuine, comfortable, I practically live in these sweatpants outside of work"
1184,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Beautiful. Love it!
1185,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Love these tanktop Love these tanktop!  I bought the black, grey, white pack.  The grey tank top is a little stiffer than the others - not as silky & soft."
1186,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"A wardrobe staple!!  so comfy! I LOVE this dress!!  I will buy more, you can count on that!!!  Thank you!"
1187,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"New wardrobe addition The fabric, fit and feel is very nice. I love that it‚Äôs also dry fit. It would be awesome to have them in other colours. Good brand"
1188,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Comfy! I previously bought a size small but I prefer a baggier sweatpant, the medium is perfect."
1189,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Very cute! My granddaughter loves this dress.  The colors are very vibrant.
1190,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Will buy again Love the feel of these pants! Comfortable to work out in with no problems riding down or needing to adjust. Perfect for lounging around, working from home and even the best work out."
1191,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Comfy I'm a 4x this fits comfortably.
1192,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Like the color and fit Like the color and fit
1193,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Why ever spend more??? Great value and very comfortable.
1194,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"Nice color but thin fabric for summer The fabric is thinner than expected, like a men‚Äôs under/tee shirt.  I have to wear a slip under it and either a sweater or winter scarf around the neckline.  It runs large.  If you like a skin hugging silhouette, size down 2 sizes.  If you like a looser fit, stick to your usual size."
1195,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Nice fabric, very cute I love this shirt for yoga and for lounging. The strappy back is really cute. I may purchase in a different color."
1196,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great Great for workouts!

1198,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Buy! True fit even though I haven't washed this garment yet I don't anticipate a problem. I intend to wash and hang dry it. I recommend the purchase.
1199,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,good Great fit. If you pull them above the waist you might get a line down there
1200,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Fit Great 3x were perfect for me Fit better than I expected, I am going to order more."
1201,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Delivered on time. Runs big
1202,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Cute I took a star for incorrect size shipping. Sounds lame but I was really looking forward to this purchase and that was disappointing. The pants are really cute! But I purchased them for going home in postpartum in a size up (medium) & they sent me a small. I guess I‚Äôll just take the L and be excited to wear these later on since I don‚Äôt have enough time to return and get a new pair in time. I also learned this color (dusky pink marl) is not squat proof ‚Äúyet‚Äù. So make sure to read which ones are more ‚Äú90% squat proof‚Äù.
1203,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great purchase Fits great ! Feels great
1204,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Prefect tanks. Just prefect. These are by far the best tank tops I've ever owned, they are made with good quality they fit just perfectly and the material is great. They didn't shrink in the least bit when washing and DRYING. A+"
1205,4,B076QD9NP1,1,Small Really cute but runs really small.  I had to return.
1206,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars GREAT
1207,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"above the knee t-shirt dress that lays well and is not see-through I will admit, that if you have any extra ""tummy-fat""...a low-price body shaper fixes everything!  But even a nice pair of control top pantyhose should be good...this was a good buy...highly recommend."
1208,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"So amazing that I haven't worn it yet. Why? My kids stole it within seconds. (ordering another) GREAT shirt, amazing price."

1218,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great These are amazing! Super soft and comfy!
1219,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Not good for moderate to severe gynecomastia. So I'm rating the product 4stars only because the picture is misleading.<br />Other than that<br />Package came in a week before expected due date.<br />Shirts feel snug and size fits well.<br />Worked out in them<br />They make me sweat.<br />Overall for the price it's good.
1220,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Fits nicely wish they had more color variety

1225,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,I love this dress I love this dress! It's super cute.  For reference I am 5'5&#34; and about 110lbs.  I got the smallest size.  The dress length is perfect with sandal.  I wear it with a belt because the silhouette is too boxy for my liking.  The fabric is thin but not see through because I got the dark color.
1226,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Always a great buy I love these hoodies. Been buying them for years.  They are thick and durable wash after wash.  Colors don't fade to much.

1230,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great progress I have now been using these T-shirts for the last five months and love them. Having never had a compression shirt before I did is fabulous. If you're looking for compression shirts these are the ones you should purchase!
1231,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Beautiful, more than expected!!! Excellent fabric and beautiful design and style. Love it and highly recommend it."
1232,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Versatile dress This dress definitely needs to be worn with the hole on the front. The fabric is soft and doesn't wrinkle. Dress can be worn during the date with sneakers or sandals and jean jacket or at night with heels..
1233,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Nice Hooded Sweatshirt Grandson loves this brand of sweatshirt and I have ordered several different colors over the past two years.

1240,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Odd Reviews I am shocked at some of the reviews for these sweatpants. I have been buying them since 2019.  I work from home and LIVE in these.  I have at least 6 pairs, having worn a couple out(1-2) in 4 years is not bad. I did recently buy a pair with pockets. My others did not have pockets.  I am returning the pocket pair as they tore by the pocket. I will say the material was thinner than the non pockets.  I will continue to buy the non pockets style for as long as these are available.  I am 5‚Äô6 and 170 lbs.  I wear a 10-12 in jeans/pants and I get the XL for great comfort.  The large fits and is not skin tight but I prefer the XL.  Hope this helps clear up some of the negative reviews.  Oh and one person says you can‚Äôt machine wash and dry.  Yes you can. I have for 4 years."

1247,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Best Gym Pants The material of these pants are pretty. You can't see through them even when doing squats. They are flattering to the body all around. I gave it a 4 because they seem to shrink when you wash them. I bought a size S and I weigh 135, height 5 feet 1 inch"

There are some times I catch a glimpse in the mirror and think this dress isn't as flattering as I believe it is (it tents out quite a bit below the chest) but I LOVE IT.  This is a perfect summer dress - lightweight, airy, comfortable.  It isn't easy to wear anything under this because the neckline dips pretty low in the front and the back even with the straps adjusted but it's worth the hassle to figure that out."
1249,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love ‚ù§Ô∏è these tanks! I absolutely love these shirts. I have bought 3 (3packs). They fit perfectly and I highly suggest them.
1250,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Better Than Expected I wear these for running. While not the softest material it does dry quick and has been a staple in my running wardrobe. Again not my favorite but they work.

1256,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Soft and Sleek Because of the times that we are in, we had to buy the dresses for my granddaughter‚Äôs birthday sight unseen.  We purchased the ‚ÄúBoho Pink‚Äù style for a 12-13 year old.  She is 9 years old right now and will be turning 10 years old.  She is tall for her age, and so the length was just right.  Normally, we do not purchase clothes that are mainly polyester, but she likes how it feels.  It will be a great warm weather dress."
1257,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfort and size Love the feel and how it fits

1265,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russel still on top I tried the wanna be‚Äôs from other manufactures but they pale in comparison. Russel material and construction is quality.  Always returned the cheap knock-offs.  Russel cannot be beat.<br />Recommended
1266,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Long arms!!!! The fit is great, but the arms are too long. I might be a bigger girl but that doesn't mean my arms are super long. I'll need to have them hemmed, but all and all it fits!"

1273,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Debating on Small or Medium? The waist is definitely very high-waisted - maybe a little too high for my waist, but I am going to make it work because I enjoy them! It rolls slightly upon bending over, but not obnoxiously. I ordered a small in both top and bottom and I am very glad I did in the bottoms. The mediums (i believe) would have been too large).<br /><br />My Measurements for Reference.<br />Height - 5‚Äù8‚Äô,<br />Weight - 140lbs<br />Bust - 35in<br />Under Bust - 30in<br />Natural Waist - 27in<br />Hips - 36.5<br />Lulu Tops - 6<br />Lulu Bottoms - 4"

1275,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Awesome Fast shipping and they fit great!
1276,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Bright, Warm and Comfortable. The sweatshirt is nice and long, if you are wearing leggings it covers your butt. It's a men's sweatshirt so the arms are big but I prefer that kind of fit. The colors are vibrant and you will stand out."

1285,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"So comfortable I would suggest for you to buy 2 sizes smaller than a normal t shirt size. I am a 5x and bought the 4x. It fits but I feel like I‚Äôm wearing a t-shirt. I have never worn this type of shirt but I expected a tighter compression. Similar to a corset, of course not as tight but close."

They aren't see through, even the white. I got the black, gray, and white 3 pack and the gray seems to be a lighter material than the other shirts, but it's still cute. Perfect for working out."

1303,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great value for the money This is a nice quality workout shirt for the money. The colors were as described. The fit is a little smaller than I expected, but these are made in china, so you should order a size larger if you plan on layering the shirt when you work out."
1304,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Very comfortable material These shirts fit smaller than excepted. I wear a small and I order a large so the fit isn‚Äôt so tight. Other than sizing i love those shirts. Great to work out in and great for wearing under my scrubs at work. I‚Äôm usually to hot for a jacket but I do get cold. These shirts don‚Äôt make me hot but keep me from getting cold

1316,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars best sweatshirts .
1317,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Love this! This hoodie is absolutely perfect, epecially at the price that I got it for (which I have noticed has increased). It's so soft and warm and fits a bit baggy on me, which is how I wanted it. I ordered a medium. The head hole however is a tad bit small which makes it a bit difficult to get on and off smoothly, but that isnt a big deal.Overall I love this sweatshirt and I would love to order more."
1318,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,EXCELLENT I was happily surprise of the quality in this product KUDOs and it wash well
1319,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good value It's a bit early to rate a sweatshirt. I usually start loving them after a year or two, but this one is comfortable and of good quality"
1320,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect Very pleased with the product nice and warm fits just right !
1321,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice but buy a size or two larger I like these. I typically wear a size large in most undershirts but I took the advice of an earlier review and purchased a size larger. They are still snug but the fit feels about right. If you want even more loose fitting, I'd suggest going two sizes larger They are relative long and I've found they stay tucked in nicely."
1322,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Awesome hoodie Great price. Great fit. Overall a very good product.
1323,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,LOVEEE I SERIOUSLY love these!!
1324,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Perfect fit, wear this hoodie from lounge-wear to outdoor wear and it does well in all conditions"
1325,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great product... Fits great.  Soft!!!  I judge a sweatshirt by the tight cuffs and neck.  5 stars...
1326,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good fit Good product
1327,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great dress I love everything about the dress. Super comfortable and love the pockets.
1328,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Great quality I would order this garment again.
1329,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"These are VERY cheaply made I mean, they don't have a complete seam, the material is practically see-through and the fabric is alarmingly flimsy.<br /><br />But they do keep people from seeing your neck, stomach, back and part of your sides.  So if you want a cheap shirt that prevents people from seeing most of you, this is the way to go."
1330,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,I like the shirts I like the shirts. I'm 6-4&#34; so I'd need more length so id do a XXXL<br />Colors are good and they wash well. They are nice. You can definitely wear them and be comfortable.<br /><br />Consider them approved!!!
1331,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Overall, a new favorite. My husband loves it. Not too bulky, good for layering. Neck hole was a little tighter than expected but, still comfortable. We will be ordering more, and he appreciates the variety of colors!"
1332,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good basic workout shirts Everything I was expecting. Wicks away sweat and keeps you cool. Been walking/running in 80 degree whether and haven‚Äôt felt the need to switch to a short sleeve. They do ride up but if you where high waisted leggings it isn‚Äôt a big deal as most compression shirts ride up during runs
1333,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great workout shirt! I'm 6 ft and 200lbs. and the large size of this shirt fits and looks great.  The material is light and breathable.  I have experienced some snags from my weight belt, but even so, when I need new workout shirts I'll order some more of these.  They are a great deal at the price!"
1334,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Awesome fit
1335,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,I like this hoodie. It has a nice thick large hood and is comfortable. The hood actually covers my whole head and doesn't just cover like half or 3/4 of my head. Not crazy about the elastic waist riding up above my belt sometimes and then having to adjust it back down but not a big deal. I still like it.
1336,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Perfect as an undershirt. I love these I'm training for the army national guard and this shirt wicks away sweat and keeps me cool and warm while I work out or run.
1337,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Women's workout tops Bought these for working out. Can wear as casual gear as well. Flattering fit.
1338,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Not bad Would have preferred a longer fit. It rides up a bit. Other than that it's great
1339,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Attractive, Fits well, no restrictions on movement, sweat wicking works. No complaints.  Works well and have gotten compliments on it from the crew I train with."
1340,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"This dress was full of adorable puppies! My grandaughter is 6 years old and absolutely loved this dress upon first sight!  She has worn this dress numerous times and claims it is a favorite! Recently she went on vacation with her family and wanted to pack it in her suitcase! I got a picture from her on vacation, wearing the dress with a big huge smile upon her face.<br />I look forward to finding other dresses like this for her.<br />The material was very silky but did not cling.  It was lightweight so very comfortable to wear despite the heat and humidity outside."
1341,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"So glad that the price Only able to find these sweatshirts online now.  So glad that the price, fit and delivery was just right"
1342,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Soft and comfortable Very soft, and comfortable. Looks cute on, can‚Äôt wait to wear. Nice and casual, would recommend, no problems with seller, would order in different color."
1343,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good quality, but is like a size bigger Good quality, but is like a size bigger. The color is darker, is like a wine, not like in the picture, but is nice color too. The pullover was for my son, I ordered Size S and I had to give it to my husband who is between a M and L size. Pls buy a size smaller than you usually use."
1344,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Awesome tanks I absolutely love these tanks.... I bought 2 more sets of 3!!!
1345,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Not camel toe proof!!! These fit really well‚Ä¶ other than the camel toe!! Make sure you wear thick underwear if you have a bigger fupa lol<br /><br />I ordered a size medium 5‚Äô5 200lbs bottom heavy. True to size.<br /><br />Super long tho.
1346,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars About as good as I would ever expect for a sweat shirt

1353,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice Fleece at a good price! Nice fleece. Fits as described. Russell says it all. Does the job!
1354,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Solid sleeveless hoodie I picked up a size L 3 pack. I'm 5'7 200 with about a 46"" chest.  For me the chest fit was very good. It's a little long for me--goes down to my butt, so when I run, I feel the fabric on my tummy. As others have said, it doesn't wick very well and sticks a little bit (after a hard CrossFit workout). Overall it's a good buy, I'm happy."
1355,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Happy with the purchase! Fits good.  Order a size larger to compensate for shrinkage.
1356,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great  Sweatshirt Wonderful Product a Great Value

1358,4,B0928FSGGD,1,They're Ok. I bought these shirts the other day and I like them but they fit loose. If you really want compression then order a size down.  Other than that the material is nice not flimsy.  The price is great because you get the three shirts.
1359,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Color
1360,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Super comfy! Actually reach my ankles, are super soft, and have pockets!  What more do you want from joggers?  I'm 5'6"" with a long torso.  122lb."

1370,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Amazing Design This product design is amazing due to the fact that it fabric is comfortable and fit perfectly .
1371,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"This fit just like I thought it would This fit just like I thought it would. As someone who has lost 100pounds since purchasing it still fits fine despite the sleeves which are slightly long, but thats because i'm 5'5 and bought this so ya thats on my odd body shape. Went from 280 to 170"
1372,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Comfortable Perfect
1373,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Good quality The waistband was too small and they rolled down, other than that they were good quality for the affordable price"
1374,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Soft and comfortable all day These are made of super soft material but the material is thin and would be better worn with a bra if you want.

1393,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars xcel.
1394,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Its comfortable A lot of moisture wicking clothing is just itchy or scratchy to me.

I have a 50 inch chest and the 3XL fit perfectly just the way I like it. Its not tight or snug so order your true size if you want a perfect fit. Go one size smaller if you want a tighter fit. Will definitely order another set of colors.

1452,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great quality and price! I like the way these shirts fit, and is a great addition to my fitness wardrobe."
1453,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Fits well Like it so much,will by it again for my little brother"
1454,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Ok, comfortable but smaller than expected Comfortable, like the material. Much tighter than expected based on my review of other reviews though. I‚Äôm usually a M/L at 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 145lbs - I ordered a large. Should have ordered XL. I use it to layer under other shirts since it does not feel flattering and feels too small."
1455,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars fit is good quality is good
1456,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Fit Perfect fit! I ordered a size M and I have 190lb!
1457,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Would buy again Product fits nice. Super comfy. Fabric is soft and stretchy! Nice pants!
1458,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Good fit. I bought these for my husband and he loves them. Nice snug, but comfy, fit."
1459,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Order size up Definitely order a size up. I‚Äôm usually a large and I got these in XL and they are right like they are suppose to be. I wear them under my works shirts when it‚Äôs colder outside and they are perfect. Be careful because they will keep you plenty warm.
1460,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great tank tops Great light weight tanks for working out. Good price!
1461,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Five Stars The fits is great....need more colors
1462,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"The BEST!!! Absolutely love them. SO comfortable, squat proof, stay put while working out (never had to pull them up), flattering, don't show sweat. Can't say enough good things about them. I don't want to take them off! So far I've gotten charcoal ombre, indigo, & marine blue and they are all squat proof. I'm 5'9, 125 lbs and have both small and XS."
1463,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Measure your chest before ordering. Comfy, but if you have a bigger bust, the bust runs tight! I'm only a b/c and the 2X is tight on me."
1464,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Great little summer dress This dress fits me Perfect!<br />I just don‚Äôt understand the tie on the one shoulder, but that‚Äôs what makes it different."
1465,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Noice Quality material didn't get itchy once you start sweating
1466,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"absorbs sweat! Loooved these shirts, I workout hard and these shirts are amazing great purchase! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 around 140lbs and I ordered size small"
1467,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Slightly irregular two of the shirts were as expected but one of them while it was the same size as the others, didn't fit the same as the other two. Overall, great quality undershirts."
1468,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Husband wears it a lot!
1469,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Can be worn to the beach on a boat or to a wedding Loved it looks really nice It did shrink when washed but still fits okay I bought a dress to go to a wedding and I'm actually going to use this because it's so comfortable and pretty ‚úåüèº
1470,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Love these shirts.  Very comfortable.
1471,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Good Training Sleeveless Basic data: I got the 3 pack, Medium. I'm 35 yo, 6' tall and 206lbs. I reckon I'm well built. The t-shirt fits perfect. Although I know that people with a bit of a belly wont find it a nice fit. However I'd recommend trying it at least. On a side note, a personal preference, I would love if the shirt was a couple inches longer; maybe even just one, it would make it feel more premium, as in, more stylish. The quality of the fabric is good however within the margins of ""economic fabric"". I recommend 90%."
1472,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Ok, not great It's just not what I expected for ""compression."" Not tight enough to hold the jiggly bits firmly still, but sure shows them off. Was hoping it would be more compress i'll on toward skin with maybe a second layer that s looser to camouflage. I kept them; good under sweaters. I'll keep looking for that double layer thing."
1473,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"I love these, they‚Äôre very comfortable and also squat proof I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and it‚Äôs hard to find leggings that fit right on my body, but there were great!"
1474,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great tank Just what I was looking for. Big arm holes that show off the sports bra, making your torso look leaner. I'm 5'5"", 120lb and XS was great: a little looser and comfortable. Definitely on the long side, but that can be fixed by tucking in or cutting 1"" off the bottom."
1475,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Fits my expectations perfectly Fabric is exactly what I wanted and the colors are so vibrant! The fit is great as well!
1476,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect lounging sweatshirt Noting facny but exaclty what I'm looking for when just laying around the house.
1477,4,B09M6X79V9,1,decent tank but needs more compression I bought these as they were supposed to be compression tanks there is about half the compression I was hoping for and I bought a  size smaller than normal.  otherwise quality is what I expected
1478,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Good quality summer dress! I just live this dress! The material is nice, it looks good with flats for casual look or you can style it with high heels/belt for night out! And it has pockets! I think I‚Äôll order one more in another color."
1479,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"True to size if your like a very snug fit.  Good quality. This is a good quality stretch fabric.  The colors are as pictured.  The size chart says small fits bust size 31-33"" ... I'm a 35, but it still fits me because I like my shirts snug.  Size up is you like it loose."
1480,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars comfortable fit
1481,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Comfortable but not for me These joggers were super cuter and the material was so comfortable. However, I didn‚Äôt keep these because the fit didn‚Äôt look good on me around my legs and knees. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and have very short and thick legs so these didn‚Äôt work out for me as expected. If they did I would have totally gotten more!"
1482,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Fit and comfort They fit perfectly and are so comfortable to wear
1483,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Yes! Finally a sweater that fits perfectly ‚ô° I got a 5x and it fits well.. I am 5'10 and weigh 220 pounds and I have 48 DDD chest and it's perfect.. I like them to be a bit bigger it goes over my big booty it's perfect!
1484,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,great for working out I'm only 5'10&quot; 169lbs this shirt fits really well. I like the way it sits on the shoulders and it allows my body to breath while working out.
1485,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Super cute Great for the 4rh
1486,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars I like it but it is too large, will have to return"
1487,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"But the colors are really pretty and it's good for a light cover up Cute product, but way too short. It's nowhere near the length portrayed in the picture, and the back comes up about an inch above my jean line. Sleeves are also short. But the colors are really pretty and it's good for a light cover up."
1488,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Five Stars Perfect fit
1489,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Work well but run small These run very small. I normally wear a medium to large depending on brand. Based on the size chart, I ordered a XL and they are still very tight, especially under the armpits. I bought them to wear under my scrubs during winter months. They are working well for me, but I do recommend ordering a larger size for comfort."
1490,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Four Stars Loose fitting and cool, nice but not a compression shirt"
1491,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great dress It's very cute and well-made. I got it for my daughter to wear as part of her Halloween costume and I'm glad to see she'll be able to wear it for quite a while.
1492,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good deal for the price This is a great sweatshirt.  Size does seem slightly larger than the average XL nowadays.  Haven't washed it yet so can't comment on shrinkage.
1493,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Simple dress that is very cute! The dresses I bought for my daughter were royal blue,  and the other was a red wine color.  Both dresses were very cute.  These dresses can be worn as ""dressy"" or casual.  I ordered a size small for my 5'5 119 lb. daughter. Both were a perfect fit.  It was also a great length--a couple inches above the knee. The dresses are very comfortable!"
1494,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Quality I suggest washing before wearing the first time.  It softens the fabric and does not shrink much.  Very comfortable and warm on a cold day.  I bought another one because of the fit and overall comfort.  Given the price, it is a great value."
1495,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product Great feeling shirt- breathable and good color choices..highly recommended!!!
1496,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Decent, not great, good value. Not a compression shirt just a slightly snug tank top. Comfortable enough. Don't expect it to suck up your gut or offer any support but it does it's job.<br />Your milage my vary.<br />Fyi I ordered the large."
1497,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Awesome Love it!!!! Feels amazing. My first dress purchased off amazon and will not be my last. Ive been looking for another. Very pleased with lilbetter.
1498,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Definitely size up! I usually wear medium but thought that large would be best in this fitted shirt. Wound up having to return it for an XL.
1499,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,These are great tank tops just order the other colors These are great tank tops just order the other colors
1500,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect fit I have three of these. Bought elsewhere two of them. Better price on here! Favorite go to dress. Will buy more!
1501,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Fits my needs. A nice basic long sleeve compression-like material shirt. Just wanted a cheaper alternative to underarmour type clothing to wear at work. It's actually pretty warm and good quality. Cute colors and fit like I wanted and expected.
1502,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cute! Summer dress! A bit baggy under the arms, but soo cute!"
1503,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"I need to buy more! I have three of these in different colors (beige, green and purple). These are my FAVORITE workout tops for running and lifting. Loose, light and flattering to the body! Perfect for spring and summer."
1504,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great fit and very comfortable Nice and sleek, fits excellent"
1505,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Quality Well pleased with product.
1506,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Size M is a little too big, S a little too small I would say I was really impressed with the quality and how it looks. I ordered size M at first but it's was big around my hip and waist so I returned at got size S. Everywhere fit but around my legs and quads are a bit tight. I appreciate that the waist is not too tight because people need to breath and live but it doesn't compress enough to hide your lower belly."
1507,5,B09M6X79V9,1,True to size I like these
1508,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love ‚ù§Ô∏è it Perfect fit!

1518,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great Comfort Great Price! NIce and cozy always buy these for my daughter as she prefers a mens fit to the too fitted womens fit =)

1523,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"True to Size...cute!! I was just looking for an everyday black casual dress, (I have a short sleeved one that I love and I wanted a long sleeved version), and this is it!  Nice modest neckline, great length, not too short, (I'm 5'4"" for reference).  When I wear it I get a ton of compliments, it's a basic but I love you can pair it with anything, a fun colored scarf...or brown croc boots, a white leather jacket...it's so versatile.  You need this staple in your wardrobe and it's very figure flattering.  I usually buy a medium in Amazon's dresses and this was perfect."
1524,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Bought for my friend he looks great! I bought this for a friend because he makes deliveries and is usually in the rain and weather fits him great he looks great and it and it keeps him dry.
1525,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Jacket Gave it to my husband as a gift and it fit perfect and he loved the jacket
1526,5,B09M6X79V9,1,The fit Nothing
1527,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Good quality and soft inside Washed it and it didn‚Äôt shrink which is great. We used it for our Alvin and the chipmunks costumes last year.
1528,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Right for Very comfortable
1529,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Decent Quality for Price I like the fit, but I ordered up a few sized based on other reviews. I use these as an under-layer to keep warm when playing softball at night. The sleeve length is decent, and the shirt length is ok...when staying still. Unfortunately, it rolls up pretty consistently when I'm running around. Would have been nice to have an extra inch or two in torso length, or more sturdy fabric, but I think it might stay put better on a leaner figure.<br /><br />I think they're a good value though, for the cost when compared to similar items. I usually wear Women's Size 8, Medium and I like it fitted but not unflattering tight. The largest size (XL) fits without being too constricting but I don't think I would wear it alone without a layer underneath to smooth things out."
1530,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars fit perfect great outdoor color
1531,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"This dress ‚ù§Ô∏è I love EVERYTHING about this dress. Fabric quality, flow, length, comfort, design. Only wish I had bought earlier in summer to wear longer without a sweater."
1532,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"MUST HAVE JOGGERS I love these joggers.  They are so silky, soft, comfy and all the things great.  I normally wear an XL but ordered up just in case and I am glad I did.  The XXL fits perfectly.  Everyone needs a pair of these!"
1533,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great quality Great quality product. I'm 6' 3  and weigh 225lbs. I wear them to the gym and they are great for working out. Fitted on the chest and relaxed around the midsection.
1534,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Lovely dress.  Ordered her an xl cause of her girls.  She's about 5'7 about 185. I just ordered me a l.  5'4/167/b cup Got for sis in law.  Fits her beautiful...she loves the pockets...
1535,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars excelent
1536,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Casual sundress Nice looking dress that flatters curvy woman. Comfortable material, not to light but great for Florida summers. I laced tie to front instead of on side. This is my go to dress for casual affairs."
1537,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Old fashioned sweat shirt Been looking for old fashioned sweat shirt. Hard to find . This one fit the bill perfectly
1538,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Comfortable!!!! It fits well. I ordered size S and I‚Äôm usually XS, but I do like these pants being a bit more roomy. I already have 3 pairs!"
1539,5,B009R09Z8W,1,I love my rainbow jacket I love it being  a true hippy this is my new favorite jacket and it's perfectly colored
1540,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfy Comfy
1541,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,The fit Ordered these for a friend (size m). They were just amazing and the fit was just right.. already looking into ordering a few more
1542,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Size up I read the reviews (so glad I did) before buying which is why I ordered a size up. I normally get a large in bottoms/pants and reading the reviews let me know that I needed x-large. The pants fit great and I really think I would have been quite sorry if I had ordered a Large.They're cute and comfortable just make sure to size up and you're good!
1543,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good Ran a little bit large for a medium for me but overall good quality breathable shirts for the gym
1544,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Just what I wanted!!
1545,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"AWESOME pants They are so beautiful these pants. If you're on the bigger size ... Definitly go a size bigger. I got 2 different pairs, one for my teen(whose husky) and a pair for my tween(whose petite). My teen I have to get next size up amd my tween they r perfect with room to spare for more growth. They are comfy....side pockets and all around a great buy."
1546,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"great fit i have a hard time finding sweats that fit properly...love these...this is my second pair...but be careful...if the design on the sweats is different, they will fit differently...I had to send back another pair"

1548,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Perfect
1549,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love this dress Fits true to size.
1550,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Exceeds expectations These are the best and most comfortable pants
1551,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Lighweight Perfect base layer for wearing baggy tanks overtop to workout in. Don't like to worry about revealing anything while doing burpees so these do the job well. If wearing alone, fabric is a little see-through. Slightly compressive or form fitting but lightweight and airy so not restrictive."
1552,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,good quality fit as expected... would buy again in diff colors
1553,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Adorable, easy dresses for kids These dresses are so easy and so darn adorable.  It's nice to have a few synthetic dresses that don't get worn out and stained immediately.  These last past one season.  My daughter loves the designs, especially this ridiculous kitten one.  Sizing is accurate."
1554,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Highly Recommend I love these leggings. They are a gym shark lookalike. They are squat proof but not sweat proof. I also purchased in another color. I highly recommend them.
1555,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,The jacket has a good weight. It is working well My husband works in a refrigerated building.  We bought this to layer with other shirts to keep him warm.  The jacket has a good weight.  It is working well.
1556,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"size down for more compression I was looking for a compression shirt and I ordered based of my normal size. I like these but there isn't as much compression as I expected  in the stomach/waist. I should have sized down (I usually wear small in tops). Overall a nice top, I would just suggest sizing down if you're looking for more support."
1557,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars It was okay
1558,5,B076QD9NP1,1,This became her favorite dress. We got it as a gift for ... This became her favorite dress.  We got it as a gift for our great grand daughter who loves animals.

1562,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Wow Surprised! Didn't have high hopes but this dress is super flattering!The material is kind of silky and I'm glad it's not embroidered. I'm 5'8"", wear a 14-16, 40DD and ordered the XL. It was perfect. I was pleasantly surprised!  Too bad it's getting cold b/c it's the perfect summer dress."
1563,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Four Stars Great for workout!
1564,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good quality It was a perfect fit according to the chart
1565,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Exactly what I was looking for Great anytime I have one on under my normal shirt people think I loss a good amount of weight

1567,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"True to size Russell makes the only hoodies that for me are true to size.I wear a 2XL(5'11""/215lb) and in all other brands i have to size up and end up with a hoodie thats too big..these are not the softest hoodies but they're not uncomfortable..fairly priced.."

1569,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable &warm It‚Äôs a quality thick sweatshirt
1570,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Good, but.. it fits good, the hood is runs a little small though."
1571,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars Nice sweatshirt, but runs big!"
1572,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,so cozy and GREAT quality! I ordered this sweatshirt for a DIY project.  I was pleasantly suprised by the quality and coziness of this sweatshirt.  I plan on getting more in more colors.

1577,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Fit me perfect Hi I m 6'1 height tall 260 pounds, this shirt fits me perfectly"
1578,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Awesome sweatshirt. Be advised that a medium is actually a large.
1579,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Fits perfectly
1580,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Not for rolls I love the leggings. They are super comfortable. Can't see through them. My one and biggest issue is the waist rolls if you are constantly bending over or changing from standing to a sotting position and visa versa.
1581,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,good quality christmas gift
1582,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good product. Just a lil short. Could be longer. Overall good buy. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt like they could have been longer. I'm 6'0 230. Low waist line. Other than that. Great fit. Nice material. I'd definitely would buy more. Given my size I got the XL and worked how I wanted them to. Compression. Good product.
1583,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Squat proof Not exactly seamless but still super comfy and squat proof!
1584,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Order down for tight fit. Product fits good. I ordered one size down this time and I like the fit better than the size I measured at.
1585,5,B009R09Z8W,1,lots of colors!! Pretty nice. Great price!!!
1586,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great Joggers I love these! They are a mix between a jogger and legging. Super comfy! I will be buying more!
1587,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Will be buying more! Great fit! Solid quality!
1588,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"This Hoodie is very comfortable and the color will last for a few years! You can wear this in cool weather unzipped; you can wear it in cold weather zipped with the hood and stay warm. Wind will not blow through this hoodie either. I have owned one for about two years, I ordered a new one and put them both on back to back - it was hard to tell the new from the old! Love it! If you buy the right size it has a nice athletic fit."
1589,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good underware. I ordered one size up as I don't want a tight fit. The material is good. I used it undef my T-shirt for motion comfort.
1590,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Tee Good heavyweight shirt
1591,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Wish I Could Keep Them I got two of these dresses, and although I like them I have to return them both.  I gave a high rating because these dresses are beautiful, and very well made.  Unfortunately, the top portion of the dress is just too small. It fits tight across the chest in a way that flattens the breast area.  The bottom part fits well, but the top makes it look like I'm wearing something that is too small for me.  I ordered size small in the leopard print and black polka dot.  I'm afraid that if I size up, the dresses will fit better up top, but then might be too big and billowy from the waist down.  Except for the top part, everything else about these dresses fit me perfectly!  I even thought about just cutting off the top half, and adding some elastic to the waist to turn them into maxi skirts.  I think that if there was a bit more spandex, the dress would have more give to it and might fit better on top.  They do have some spandex added, but not enough.  Which means if you tug on the material, you will feel just a very, very slight amount of give.  About the same about of give if spandex were added to a silk fabric.  You would more feel the tautness of the silk, rather than the stretch of the spandex.  The style is flattering because it gives the dress more of a feminine shape, and a less boxy look.  Be aware that these dresses have a seam down the back and the FRONT.  If your order a print or floral design, just be mindful that the design on the front of the dress might not line up with the front seam.  The seam on my black polka dot was nicely done, but this may not be the case with other designs.  My suggestion to the maker would be to make the top portion larger or add more stretch so that there is more give and less tightness and flattening in the chest area.  I still might swap the small out for a medium and see how that works.  If I do, I will give an update."
1592,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Shirts were nice and worth the price Shirts were nice and worth the price.  Different style and quality from medium to large.  Medium appear to be better made and look like they‚Äôd last longer.
1593,5,B07XD71F1H,1,A cute dress for Different Occasions A good dress for a variety of occasions. Can be dressed up with stocking and shoes or worn with tights and boots for something a little more boho.
1594,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,LOVE I was worried about buying these because let‚Äôs be real.... clothes on Amazon aren‚Äôt always the best quality. I bought these for under my scrubs because I was too lazy to go to the store. I‚Äôm glad I did!! These are exactly what I was looking for. Great quality and extremely comfortable! Love the fabric.
1595,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars I looked so chill in this!
1596,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"If your a 40 or maybe even a 39, go with large. The material and the shirt itself is great! I like it a lot. My chest was at a 40. On the chart it says I should order the medium, so I did. It fits but its tight. I'm going to keep, but also I'm going to order a set of large also. I have my large now and it does fit better."
1597,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Size down and buy ! BUY! I was super skeptical because this looks like such a gymshark dupe and I like my brand name clothing. But I actually like it better! Squat proof and light weight! I usually hate wearing full length pants because I sweat a ton and get hot Easily but these don‚Äôt feel hot at all! I ordered a SMALL based on reviews. Never in my life am I a small I get a 6 or 8 in lulu align. My waist is 28‚Äù hips 41‚Äù 5‚Äô5 137lbs . Also VERY high waisted! I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt be high enough with my butt and it‚Äôs almost too high!
1598,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Love it Very flattering cut
1599,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,The best tank tops around I love these tank tops. They are so comfortable for working out in or just lounging around the house. The sweat is wicked away great. I highly recommend these to anyone.
1600,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice i guess String falls out on its own
1601,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Nice summer cover I got this for a new job and i actually got positive comments about it. Its light weight, it flows, it covers, its a little big but in a good way. I live in florida but i work inside so its still hot and not as freezing in side as we would like. So this light weight top works even being long sleeve."
1602,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Rey comfortable It is a good stuff.
1603,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Best joggers ever! These drawstring joggers are my absolute favorite! Buttery soft fabric and very comfortable. Ordered in two other styles! I prefer the drawstring, as they are less restricting than the full elastic waist style. Love these!!"
1604,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Fits great...True to size
1605,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,They are so comfy I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù 125 and got a size small.<br />These are the most comfortable workout leggings I‚Äôve ever purchased.<br />I‚Äôm tried lots of other brands but these move with my body and don‚Äôt have to constantly readjust them.<br />Lint doesn‚Äôt stick to them either so they always look fresh too.<br />Will be buying more colors for sure.

1611,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Top notch quality. Excellent quality hooded zip-up sweatshirt. I've tried many makers and this one is the very best quality to date. Will buy many more. Better than expected. Buy with confidence.
1612,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Fit just right The chest, waist fits right, the height is perfect. Im 255lbs, 5'9"" and it fits great. Some may find it longer in the torso, but the way the design is, it is made for those who wear tights instead of shorts. So im not complaining"
1613,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Love this little dress Wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect since there is good and bad reviews about this dress, but I love it on, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 1/2‚Äù, 155 lbs and busty, the large fits perfect, a smaller size definitely wouldn‚Äôt fit. My only complaint is that it bells out at the bottom, it‚Äôs not quite as ‚Äòbody con‚Äô as it looks in the picture."

1621,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Very comfortable Love these things.  I got several colors.  I probably should have not got the black.  It collects hair and you can see it.  I like these shirts because they are so soft and comfortable.  I actually got one at my Son's school with his school logo, and wore it all the time because it was so comfortable.  I then bought 3 more on here for the price of the one at the school.  Very happy.  I will prob buy more."
1622,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good for work out. Make you look bigger Good workout shirts
1623,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"A little bit tighter than expected, but not enough ... A little bit tighter than expected, but not enough to make it uncomfortable.  I prefer the fit more than the typical oversized-balloon you often get with other sweatshirts."
1624,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Little snug I got a small and it feels a little tight so I can't really wear it as loungewear but I think they are great for working out.

1651,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great fit and feel. I bought these because I've been ruining regular white t-shirts and regular tank style shirts stretch out and come untucked during a work day. These fit exactly as expected. They hold all day long and do well at wicking away moisture. The price is not bad, either! Recommend washing before first use."

There‚Äôs a few different sellers under this product but I bought three hoodies from the Kiwisota seller. 2/3 hoodies were true to picture and the third was a different color than what was pictured. I contacted the seller about the issue and they responded super quickly! I was able to get refunded for the one hoodie so I will be buying another from them.<br />All hoodies were true to size, nice bold color and soft interior without being too heavy. I will be getting a lot of wear out of these. Thank you Kiwisota!"

1668,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not compression but moisture wicking! Nice tank tops for the price.  Seems I'm always running out of tank tops before laundry day, so I purchased 2 packs of these.  I wasn't expecting &#34;compression&#34;, so I wasn't disappointed because they are NOT compression.  However, they are moisture wicking.  After an hour on my spin bike, I'm a sweaty mess... but these tanks keep me dry.  I purchased an XS because I wanted a tight fit.  They definitely run large!  Size 2 sizes down is you want a &#34;spandex&#34; type fit otherwise they're going to be baggy."

1671,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"So far, best on the market I believe that neleus makes superb active clothing, some designs would be nice. But if it's Swole Town you're headed to this gear fits well. It's durable as well.  I have other Neleus gear that is still in very good shape after a year and a half and you know how much we wash gym clothing. 9/10...just because i want more designs üòÖ"
1672,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Pretty nice...... I got these as a present. Nice and comfortable tank tops. They fit as expected. I wish they were just a little bit longer though, as they tend to ride up a little when I wear them as an undershirt. But overall a nice fit."
1673,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great gift idea for the lady that works out I bought this item for my wife, she recently started going to the gym, so I thought this would be a good gift, and it was she loved the way they fit and the different colors."
1674,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice weight! Husband is 6'1"" and wears a 16 ... Nice weight!  Husband is 6'1&#34; and wears a 16 1/2 34/35 dress shirt, and I ordered him a size large and it fit perfectly.  He owned same sweatshirt, bought several years ago and it was a size XL, but based on other reviewers we went with size L and it fit the same as the old XL."
1675,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Not bad The seams are a bit thick, making these less than max comfort. But, they are made from durable breathable material and I like the cut."

1677,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars Nice item, good quality.  Arrived as expected."
1678,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product! I do a lot of running and gym activities ranging from CrossFit to power lifting. This is actually my second pack of tanks from Neleus Pro company.

1681,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Order a size down if you have a large chest I bought this because I wanted my rib tattoo to be visible when I workout :)<br /><br />I'm 5'4&#34;, 140lb and have 32Fs and I bought a small. I also tried on a medium but because of the cut and my boobs it looked like a tent. If you are a small person/small chested a larger size could look cute and drapey, otherwise I would size down.<br /><br />Material was kind of thin but not see through and is nice and breezy for working out.<br /><br />Overall I really liked it and I got a ton of compliments at the gym. I'll be buying a few more colors soon :)"
1682,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,These are great Love these shirts. Look great and feel great. Large is a little bit tighter than I expected. I wear a 42 suit jacket and a large is a bit snug. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 200# I will order more but maybe try XL. Overall I am satisfied

I normally wear a s-m and accidentally purchased the large, but the large fits just fine. So be careful about sizing. These are designed to be semi-snug like a legging."
1700,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits like a glove It is nice to be able to buy cloths that are cut to fit a regular size person.  What I mean is that I wear a xxl size and the sleeves  on this sweatshirt were made for someone who had meat on their arms.  Not someone who never lifted a weight.<br /><br />Russell made a nice sweatshirt that fits correctly and does not look to be of low quality.  I would buy it again.

1712,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,A big man needs good clothes Hard to find sweat shirts that fit great without sleeves that stretch to my knees so these were a good find.

1734,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great shirts, just size down if you want it less baggy Great shirts, with a jersey-like material that breaths and is way lighter than things like basketball jerseys. My only gripe is that the sizes are off. I am 5'9"", 170, and the small fits me like a medium does in other brands"
1735,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good quality I‚Äôve bought 2 packages of these workout tops and I love them! I like the tight fit , don‚Äôt have to worry about the top coming up doing certain exercises. I highly recommend!"
1736,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Perfect Workout Shirts These shirts are exactly what I was looking for. Fit feels perfect to me and the material is great! Not heavy but not so light that it is see through! I am so glad I made this purchase. I actually went back the day I got them in and ordered more!
1737,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great Company I couldn't be happier with Joe's Surf Shop!  They truly stand by their products and are very quick to respond to any issue you may have with their merchandise.

1758,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable Hoodie this was prefect for what i was looking for,<br />a comfortable loose hoodie to wear around the house on cold days"
1759,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,As expected. Thin but not terribly.
1760,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,He loves Russell's Hoodie The hubby adores this cozy hoodie. He wears a Large but likes the extra room in an Xtra Large hoodie.
1761,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,So comfy These are the most comfortable pants I have ever put on my body. I work in residential care and I bought these to be comfortable at work. Totally worth it! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 around 120 lbs and the smalls fit me perfectly. They‚Äôre very flattering and light weight.
1762,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Comfortable Comfortable fit
1763,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars a little larger than normal but will always go out of my way to get a Russell sweat shirt!!

1765,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"LOVE IT THE FIT IS RIGHT, THE LOOK IS RIGHT"
1766,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good sweat shirt Larger than typical.
1767,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,More then expected!!! I liked the material and the way the dress fell. It looked better then I expected.
1768,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,Very good looking and well made Runs Small.  Order up a size
1769,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good material. Allows me to breathe through it. Maybe i should have gotten it a little smaller so it would work better but seems like a good product so far
1770,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,love it LOVE this. Fabric is soft and the straps are adjustable. I'm 5'7&#34; and it hit past my ankles.
1771,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Great deal
1772,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great purchase On time and exactly what I was hoping for, will probably buy more"
1773,4,B076QD9NP1,1,"Daughter loves it My daughter loves dogs, so she was thrilled with the dress.  She is 6 years old, 50 inches tall, and an average, athletic build.  The 8/9 is a tad big on her, but not so big that she can't wear it.  The material is slinky and stretchy.  I haven't washed it yet, but I don't think it will shrink."
1774,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Definitely will buy more!! Exact dupe for gymshark
1775,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Love the pockets!!! The pockets are great, especially the one on the inside of back waistband. I'm 5'7 and length in Med was perfect. Might be short on taller ppl. Impressed by quality, seriously comparable to top brands. I will be buying more! Very supportive high waist, and comfy looseness in legs. I typically wear small but medium in these were perfect due to tight, supportive waist. Kim K and Lululemon purchase their items from factories such as where these came from and rebrand to hike price up. Seriously, these are top quality. I would say sizing is a little small. Order up."
1776,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice and comfortable. Very good quality for a hoodie! Perfect, just what I was hoping for. I'm 5'9&#34; female, 185 lbs and the sleeves are long and the hood actually is a nice full hood and not one of those dinky small flimsy ones. Soft also! Waiting to wash and see if it shrinks up any."
1777,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Flattering and Perfect fit!! I got a black pair and I love these!!!! They fit perfectly, flattering and are probably one of the most comfortable pants I have worn. I also work out with them they don't seem to slide down while I run, jump or lift definitely recommend getting them."
1778,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Great product at a great price! I absolutely love these sweat pants..they fit well and look nice not sloppy. And they're soft inside. !! Already ordered another pair in a different color!
1779,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Love these! Perfect sizing. I wear these around the house, for working out, walking or running in my neighborhood,  and to bed. They are very comfortable. The sizing guide was spot on for me which is usually not true on this app."
1780,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,It fits perfect. I absolutely love it So soft. It fits perfect. I absolutely love it!
1781,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Order a size down Boyfriend usually wears a XL in sweatshirts and hoodies but this XL was baggy.<br />We probably should of ordered a large.
1782,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great tanks. Very comfortable Loved the fit. Made my chest look great and I looked pretty jacked overall. Gonna buy more
1783,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great Very form fitting. Breathable material. Great for the gym.
1784,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Described exactly I ordered it a few sizes bigger, so it‚Äôd be flowy. It‚Äôs exactly how I wanted it. Looks exactly as described."
1785,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Husband approved! The first day I worked these leggings:<br /><br />Husband ‚Äúyour butt looks extra perky today.‚Äù<br />Me ‚Äúthanks! These leggings are magic.‚Äù<br /><br />These are so comfortable! I purchased 5 different colors of the marl. Going to get rid of all my other workout leggings and only wear these.

1790,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great, comfy leggings I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and about 135 lbs. I ordered the medium and the are the perfect length and fit. They are a tiny bit loose around the lower calves but not annoyingly so. I plan to wear them for yoga and spinning."
1791,5,B0B16Q1854,1,They fit perfectly So comfy and soft and doesn‚Äôt get stretched out after a few hours of wearing them.
1792,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nooice shirt Fits as expected. Boughtbfor paintball works well for that purpose.

1798,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Cozy and warm and the best value in a lounging sweatshirt. Cozy and warm and the best value in a lounging sweatshirt. You will enjoy this indoors, unless you are channeling George Costanza and want to wear it in public. My XL is a good fit for my 6'4&#34; 235lb frame, have a long torso but it is a good, looser fit, as a sweatshirt should be."
1799,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Satisfied I wear a XX large and that's what I ordered, it fit perfectly. A little loos as I like it."
1800,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Great Dress, great fit, great material! I love the way this dress fit! It was a little loose under the arms, but otherwise fit great. 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 180-185lbs, 40D."

1804,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,very good for the price you can't go wrong. nice warm soft inside.
1805,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good Hoodie Good jacket. Comfortable.
1806,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Love this. Fit nicely Love this. Fit nicely. Colors are better in person. The only thing I didn't like about it is that the material is more tshirt than sweater/cardigan.
1807,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Need to have extra small They are still bigger than me! But I still like the color!
1808,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Repels Dog hair I love these pants, so comfy and best part is they repel dog hair!"
1809,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Good tank! Bought this for my wife and she loves it! Good material & fits as expected!
1810,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Wearable Blanket I wanted extra big, I ordered extra big, I got extra big! It's like wearing a big ol' blanket! I Love it!"
1811,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great gift! I got it for my friend for her birthday and she instantly fell in love and it fit her very nice
1812,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute summer dress Material is a little thin but it‚Äôs really cute tying the hem in a knot.
1813,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"go 1 size up 5'8 170 went L, i like it for its a bit loose but not too much"
1814,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"GREAT BUY!! These fit perfectly! i haven‚Äôt washed them yet but they are super stretchy. i love that they have an option of three different colors or all three the same. i ordered a Medium (all 3 black), like most things i order online and they aren‚Äôt uncomfortably tight."
1815,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Cute and colorful Loved the colors
1816,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"It‚Äôs squat proof! This workout outfit is SO cute and long enough for my tall gals! This color is indeed squat proof great for working out. I only gave 4 stars because I wish the waistband was smaller and that it didn‚Äôt slide while working out, because I definitely had to adjust it a few times. Overall though, especially for the price, this is a great buy! I‚Äôm a 24 waist, 35 hips, 125 lbs, 5‚Äô10 and I got a size small"
1817,5,B097RFTKJP,1,very cute dress Fits to size and very cute

1821,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Approve
1822,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars I need one in every color!!!
1823,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Five Stars There long for taller guys very happy so far with them.
1824,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Hella warm I got a large cuz<br />I wanted more of a loose look and it is my fav jacket !! Super warm!!
1825,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Great little dress! Love all the patterns, My daughter loves it! It's really soft and a bit longer than most dresses her size which in nice. We will be buying several more of these in the different patterns for school coming up."
1826,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Nice quality I got these shirts to wear as under shirts this winter. I normally wear a small-medium bought an XL and they fit perfectly! perfect for what I wanted! And they don't have the thumb holes like so many shirts this style do anymore.
1827,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars It got well
1828,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits perfect Fits perfect. Not tight around the neck.  Allows easy movement
1829,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Al.ozt Neon but great Nice sweet hoodie
1830,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"these keep me plenty cool under my work shirt I work outside in Las Vegas, these keep me plenty cool under my work shirt. No sweat shows through. EPIC. Bought another pack!"
1831,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Very sexy! Bought these shirts for my boyfriend and he loves them! Great for workouts because the shirt doesn't rise above his waist when he lifts the bar. Really shows off his muscles.
1832,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"So soft Soft, comfy, not see through, and stretchy. I could wear these to workout or lounge. Awesome product!"
1833,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,As expected As expected
1834,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good quality!! Bought a navy blue one. It‚Äôs comfortable & soft.<br />It looks just like the picture. I like wearing it with jeans or sometimes under my coat
1835,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great tanks These are my favorite brand on Amazon. Have tried the others and have been very unsatisfied.
1836,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"liked it so much i bought another might be a bit too big, but with the way clothes vary in size it may be that other items I've bought are too small... comfortable and warm.  liked it so much I bought another!"
1837,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"4X fits just fine. Love it After reading the reviews, I ordered a 4X, even though I wear a 2X.  Reviews were right, this runs small, so make sure to order at least 2 sizes up.  4X fits just fine.  Love it."
1838,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Fit perfect. I bought two sizes too big, so I could have wiggle room in it, and it so far, is one of the best pieces of clothing I've ever bought on here, the only downside is that it attracts my cat hair."
1839,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love it. Great fit and wears Love it.  Great fit and wears well
1840,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Five Stars Love this!
1841,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars To big
1842,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Does the job, will buy again Excellent tank for workouts or base layers. Lightweight, breathable, fits well."
1843,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars I like Russell Products.
1844,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfect Summer Maxi Dress I will definitely buy this dress in the other colors! I love how it fits so loose at the waist that it is flowy, yet it is very light.  The fabric, in my experience, is basically stainproof.  I spilled coffee and I dropped some of my salad with sesame dressing on it and it just wiped off without staining! I got so many compliments while wearing it and it is the perfect summer dress!"
1845,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Great little outfit for casual wear. I like my tops to not be clingy so the XL works great for me even though the sleeves are a bit long. If you want something a bit more form fitting on top (though still not clingy) the Large would work for you. I purchased the dark grey. No need for a slip or cami under this dress because the dark fabric is not sheer though it might be a different story for the light colors. Fabric has lots of stretch and is very comfy. I already ordered another in a different color. Cute outfit for casual wear. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 170lbs, 36C."
1846,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Go up a size I ordered a size large. I received a size extra large. I am very thankful that the shipping department went up a size. There is no way a size large would have fit. However I wear a large in all other clothing tops. So based on my experience I feel you clearly need to go up a size.
1847,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfortable I always order these Polo lounge pants big. I enjoy wearing them around the house. So comfortable and honestly my favorite pants for lounging.
1848,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"But the good is thick Little on the big side for a large. But the good is thick, it's soft and the arms are nice and long"
1849,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Four Stars exactly what I expected
1850,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great buy Excellent quality workout tops, and much better than far more expensive rival products. Highly recommend them."
1851,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Excellent shirts! These shirts are excellent, and high-quality! Nice, breathable mesh, and doesn‚Äôt chafe like other tanks. They fit when I receive them, but I got so much confidence from wearing them, that I pushed myself at the gym, and now my chest is too big for the shirt, lol. Will definitely be ordering more!"
1852,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"forget nike and champion I been wearing navy blue full zip front hooded sweatshirts on the job for 40 years. champion, nike, off brands, and russell is my favorite. soft warm fabric, generous fit, durable, colorfast. my only beef is that the zipper gives out before the rest of the sweatshirt. they've used metal, ykk delrin, plastic coil and they all fail while the sweatshirt is still in good condition. no problem, I get another one for dress and use the old one to shovel snow! a little hard to find on the stores so I was very pleased to find these on amazon, and in 3x! I like them with a little room to layer and to just slouch. it's a very spacious 3x."
1853,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Wish the material was a little thicker but overall great for layering. Great tank tops! I used the provided sizing chart and the fit is great! Wish the material was a little thicker but overall great for layering. Colors are vibrant.
1854,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Love these shirts!! These are just great! Just a little bit shiny and they look good so you could wear them as an outer shirt. I like to wear them as an undershirt because they  have a nice, slippery texture so clothes don't cling.  I think they are more comfortable than a cami. This is the second set I've bought. The others are over a year old and those still held their stretch and color even after multiple washes."
1855,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Comfortable non cotton tank tops that I have been looking for. These were just what I have been looking for.... non cotton tank tops. For some reason, I've had no luck finding any in stores by me so I turned to Amazon and came across these. I like to train in tank tops, but using the cotton ones ruins them too quickly due to massive amounts of sweat that doesn't seem to wash out so even after cleaning them they start to stink after awhile. So far so good with these! They're very comfortable so I even wear them occasionally as an undershirt for the office."
1856,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Makes me look (and feel) less fat These are great Man-Spanx! They do seem to lose a bit of their elasticity over time, and the quality isn't the best, but for the price I think they're a pretty good deal."
1857,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Five Stars Looks exactly like the picture. Fits great.
1858,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable for sure. Comfortable and feels soft looks good. I ordered to large for me it comes big so order down if you are medium in size.
1859,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Perfect for working in those freezing cold hospitals This fit me perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 179lbs. I got a size large and these fit me like a glove. They were the perfect length on the arms which is a big factor for me as I‚Äôm a nurse and will wear these everyday at work in the freezing cold hospitals. They were not too long or short on the torso and hug the body really well.
1860,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Recived  product quickly Going to try it out today. if it feel good i'll buy more!
1861,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good fit! Excellent quality!
1862,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Four Stars AWESOME
1863,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Old version is better When I first got these I wasn‚Äôt a fan because of how tight they were but after washing and a few wears they began to fit better. They are squat proof and the control top is awesome. I ordered a size small in Charcoal Grey, I weigh 120lbs. I‚Äôm also short and the length is good.<br />I decided I liked these so much that I wanted another pair but beware. There are two different versions of these leggings, the materials are very different. The material for the Old Version is a thicker fabric. The newer version is way more thin, a little more sheer, and more buttery soft. Although I really prefer the Old Version because they don‚Äôt feel like they will tear like I felt the new version would."
1864,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good price, and surprisingly good quality For the price, you can't beat it.  I like wearing &quot;undershirts&quot; to work out, so my outside shirt isn't so &quot;clingy&quot; during sweaty, intense workouts.  These do the job!  I was using old, white, wife beaters before, and they were fine, but thought something with compression would be better for work outs.  They are not see-thru, and can almost be worn as a Cami, or shell underneath a suit jacket.<br />I also wore them to a football game as one of my layers.  I wore 4 layers on top because it was freezing, but didn't need a jacket!  It is comfortable as well.  Hope this helps!"
1865,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Quality is the best This is a Christmas gift
1866,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Great hoodie but runs a size small. Only issue I have is that the hoodies run a little small. I bought 3 in large for a more oversized fit. After washing, they fit more like a medium than a large. I have medium with my adidas, Nike, and champion hoodies. Recommend going up at least one size."
1867,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Perfect dress for active kids. Love this dress! My daughter grabs it out of the wash immediately. She loves that it can get wet and dry quickly.
1868,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Sweatshirt! SUPER comfy and worked perfectly for the 5k I purchased it for.  It's now one of my go-to sweatshirts to wear.
1869,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Love this shirt I suggest purchasing a size down for USA customers.  I purchased a 2XL for my husband & it looks like a 3XL & the length is longer than I anticipated. length The texture of the material is of good quality and is definitely recommended depending on the gentleman preference (firm versus extreme loose fit).
1870,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,These shirts fit as I expected they would. Have ... These shirts fit as I expected they would. Have been wearing them everyday for the past four weeks and I have no complaints. I will order more.
1871,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great workout shirts. Just what I needed, simple workout shirts that are sweat proof and keeps you cool at the gym! I got a medium which is my normal size and they fit as expected. Recommended for sure."
1872,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love Yes I love the fit
1873,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great dress Seam is not in the front of the dress. It is in the back. You have it one backwards.
1874,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Perfect Used these hoodies to make matching ones for my wife and her sisters. Great quality, the transfer adhered perfectly."
1875,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Hoodie! It's a little bigger than I expected, but it is way heavier and warmer, too! I'm very happy with this purchase!"

1878,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Love them These are cute, comfortable, and perfect for my day. I wear it at the office with a blazer then take off the blazer and I‚Äôm ready for the gym. Very flattering and versatile."
1879,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits well I like the tanks if hour after smaller on top order down a. Size
1880,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Super light weight and stylish.... While I love the fit and design of this shirt, I'm afraid the quality of the fabric could be better. I think the company can opt for a better material and increase the price accordingly, people will still buy it. It is a great design !!<br />Update: second batch ordered looks a little better quality."
1881,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Well made, small fit I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 135lbs. I ordered the medium as it says they run small in other reviews. The medium was a decent fit but the sleeves are super short on a person with long arms like me. I find myself tugging at the shirt a lot. Hopefully if I lose some weight/fat, the fit will improve. There IS some forgiveness in the midsection but I find the shirt slinks up and I have to keep pulling it down. Boobs lol<br />They are well made and cute but the fit is off. I wear under t shirts for the ‚ÄúFlorida winter‚Äù and to the gym"

1896,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Comfortable & Contouring Fit Impressed! Comfortable & contours to your back perfectly.
1897,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Size up in Wine Red and Black. Normal sizing for Dark Blue Marl and Charcoal Grey! Very Comfortable! I purchased the Dark Blue Marl first in a Small, and they are perfect, no complaints! I ordered a Small in Wine Red and Black and they were both too tight & not as stretchy. Recommend sizing up in these two colors. I returned the two and repurchased the Wine Red in M and they are perfect! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù 130lbs 38‚Äù hips, 29‚Äù waist. Also the Charcoal Grey fit like the Dark Grey Marl, so a S is perfect. Favorite leggings for sure!"
1898,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great buy I love these shirts. Perfect for outdoor workouts when it‚Äôs chilly. Very comfortable. Would buy again
1899,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars god daughter loved it
1900,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Just as I Expected! yes I would recommend to someone. Is really nice for the cheap price. Its very comfortable and fits nice. I got my normal size I wear  in jackets which is a medium. The color is bright too and I love I that way!
1901,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"LOVE THESE! I work in events and joggers are the most comfortable thing to wear for long days. These are similar to a Nike Pro material but not as tight, if that makes sense? I got the Black highwaist joggers in a size small. I'm 5'2"" and weigh around 110 if that helps anyone with sizing. They don't slip down but they did pill a little bit but only because the fanny pack I was wearing with them one day was sparkly (LOL). Haven't noticed any issues and HIGHLY recommend buying if you're looking for a comfy pair of flattering joggers!"
1902,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars very pleased
1903,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Execellent
1904,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfortable These sweats are comfy and have pockets. They are slightly big but I love them.
1905,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Love it Super cute but not as thick as I hoped
1906,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,üòÅ Get a size smaller if looking for a tight fit
1907,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Cheep material decent fit I liked the way it fit. The material is very snaggy though. And the sewing was not symetrical. Fits crooked. Overall. For a running /workout. Tank. It's ok for the price
1908,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Excellent for workout Fit as expected, not the best material, but excellent relationship between the cost."
1909,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Versatile top It is a versatile top that goes with a lot.
1910,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Does the job right for right price. It doesn't hold off on the sweat amazingly but it does the job for my 2 to 4 hour sessions. I'm 5'7 and 145lbs and it fits perfect, considering I prefer a bit of a loose fit."
1911,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable I gave this hoodie to my husband as a gift and he loves it. He said it's cozy and comfortable!
1912,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Nice shirt Nice shirts but do run a little on the small side.  I ordered the small and found the arms a little too short and the length of the shirt a little short.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 125 lbs
1913,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable fit at a very reasonable price. I bought three of the Russell Athletic Met's Dri Power Crewneck Sweatshirts. Living in a cold region, they are a nice comfortable shirt to put over a lighter shirt to help keep me warm.  They fit as advertised and the price is reasonable for the quality. I wear them regularly and I feel confident they will hold up for quite a bit of time. Given that, I think they are suitable for everyday casual use."
1914,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Quality and value! Well made Hoodie at a Great price. Comfortable and fits just right!
1915,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Super cute as pictured Super cute as pictured.  Small fits slightly big but not enough to even exchange.  Fabric is light and comfortable.  Love this!
1916,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"makes me feel confident very flattering and super comfortable, highly recommend!!"
1917,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Super flattering leggings! Absolutely love these leggings! I started off with two pairs, wore them and worked out in them and needed more!<br />They made me feel good about myself too! Love how it keeps it all in!!"
1918,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"THESE ARE MY NEW FAVORITE LEGGINGS - FROM PICKIEST PERSON EVER To start, I am almost 5'9 and about 145 lbs. I wear a size 7-9 for pants. I got a size medium in charcoal grey and these seriously could not have fit any better. First of all, I have been looking for the perfect pair of leggings for YEARS. Leggings seem to always either slip down or stretch out while working out, have too much fabric around the crotch, have an uncomfortable/unflattering waistband, are see-through, etc. Ladies, you understand all these issues.<br />These leggings were so great that I am 100% convinced that I will buy a pair in every color and throw all of my current leggings away. All of the issues I listed above are nonexistent with these leggings. The waistband is not lined so it doesn't give unflattering shape and it goes above the bellybutton very comfortably. These leggings have the PERFECT amount of stretch and DO NOT STRETCH OUT while working out which seems to always be an issue. They contour to your body amazingly and have those details that make your butt look perfect. They are super comfy. The fact that I got the grey colored leggings and they barely show any sweat is unreal. I have worn these heavy lifting, to cycle class, and more and they have definitely held up with any exercise. I have already washed them a couple of times (on delicate/gentle heat) and they still are good as new.<br />Any way, this is my first and probably last review of anything I have ever bought from anywhere but I just had to share how much I love these leggings because I know there are lots of other women out there who were just as frustrated with finding the perfect leggings as I was. For $27, you cannot do any better."
1919,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Mens tops 3 pack My son love this tops
1920,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Quality Great warmth, fit and feel."

1922,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Size up Cute print! I read some reviews and decided to size up .. and it fits great.
1923,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Pretty good hoodie Will definitely keep you warm while working outside.  Little thinner than a comparable Champion pullover hoodie but still does the job.
1924,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars I love it!
1925,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great shirts Great shirts
1926,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Very comfortable This is one of the most comfortable summer dresses; that I have ever bought. I am very happy with it. Yes I would buy more.

1928,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I recommend Perfect
1929,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Depending on your build you may want to get one size larger. I like the product, lightweight, and comfortable. I am typically between a large and x-large depending on the type of shirt. I ordered these in and XL and it's a little tight in the chest. If I ordered again I would go with a 2xl. Other than that great product."
1930,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,They make your booty look incredible!! Great purchase! These leggings are AMAZING! I am going to buy 2 more as we speak. I highly recommend!! Completely squat proof and so soft.
1931,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Thumbs up Quality and comfort.  Can't beat that.
1932,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Warm up your dress with leggings Love the vibrant color and material quality.
1933,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Recommend if you want a simple and comfortable jacket. Very comfortable

1937,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"but not see through so it will work great when the weather gets a little warmer Fabric is stretch and soft.  It is thinner then I anticipated, but not see through so it will work great when the weather gets a little warmer.  She love it and it was a huge hit!"
1938,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Fav leggings!! These are by far my fav par of leggings. I have a larger butt and they still fit perfectly.
1939,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Pretty, Flowy, but thin! I took this dress on vacation in Arizona and it was perfect for the warm nights out, but it is very thin fabric, so if you get a light color expect it to be see-through. Provides a cover for your body, but zero warmth at all! The fit was flowy and very pretty, and I loved that it has pockets!!"
1940,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Good fit and comfortable I like it for layering for early morning golf without getting bulky but still keep me warm
1941,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great fit for working out or even lounge Husband loves them, bought twice. They are a great fit, comfortable and light. Loose around the belly. Material is nice & soft & after a heavy workout session no smell that was a highlight on it's own. we all know certain polyester blends smells like after a sweaty workout and these do not disappoint. Would recommend and repurchase again. At first we ordered XL but was too big and long for his height 5'8 and semi build 190Lb, we followed the size chart but was  a little off, re-ordered a Large and it fit perfect and he now wants more."
1942,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great looks and style Working out. It's a perfect shirt
1943,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love the fabric I love these tank tops. I have already bought more. Fabric is soft and fits perfectly. Hard to find good tanktops.
1944,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Hides my momma belly! These do for a little baggier than I thought. They aren't &#34;compression&#34; by very cute work out tank! hides my momma belly
1945,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great Tank Tops Fit as expected. I'm 155 lbs & ordered a Small. It fits perfectly. If you have more muscle on your frame, then order 1 size larger. Quality & workmanship is good.  I like the Y back & mesh material. Its makes for a more cool tank top for summer & the beach. I ordered the red, yellow & blue. And will be ordering another set in different colors. I highly recommend  these tank tops for style, fit, colors & comfort."
1946,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Very nice and good value for the money Very nice and good value for the money
1947,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Definitely get some! I really love these. I'm 2 months post partum and just started working out again, I ordered a medium thinking I'd have incentive to fit into them but when I tried them on they fit great. I'd have a little bit more room left if I ended up gaining a few pounds but I've actually lost 5 pounds since getting them and they fit even better! I was 154 when I bought them and I'm 5'4 and a half with an after baby belly pouch. They're fantastic, I couldnt recommend them more!"
1948,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fit my 11yr ol perfectly Bought for my daughter. She loves the lightweight fabric for gym classes and working out.
1949,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Four Stars Pretty good.
1950,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Wow Big surprise.  Great color,  price and fit<br />I prefer 100% cotton but this will definitely do- planning on getting a few more because the colors are so great"
1951,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute dress with a good fit Great casual sun dress for a good price. Nice quality fabric and nice fit.
1952,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Does Not Run Large Read a comment here that they run large, so  I bought a medium instead of large. The medium is a bit snug on me and I can't wear it as a second layer comfortably. The sweatshirt itself is good quality and a nice weight material. I'll buy a couple of large sizes next fall."
1953,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Good quality I wear these every day under my scrubs to cover my tattoos and they‚Äôre perfect because they don‚Äôt get too hot
1954,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Basic Sweater Basic, boring sweater. Just what my husband wanted"

1957,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Great value I am impressed with the product .
1958,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Nice value, comfortable too! Love wearing this under my dress blouses as I can leave a few top buttons undone. They also keep you comfortable temperature wise."
1959,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great value Nice fit. Purchased this in several colors.
1960,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits nicrly Fits exactly as expected.
1961,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,All in One Legging I love the style and comfort of these leggings.  The fact that they are seamless is one less ‚Äúitch‚Äù to worry about.  They hug and move with your bodies moves.  They also wash and retain their shape.  I would recommend these to my friends!
1962,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Comfortable and Perfect with Leggings! I just had a baby and wanted clothing to cover up my frumpy postpartum bod... this is just loose enough with leggings and very comfy!
1963,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Love it üëçüëçüëç
1964,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Nicely done. I like it would be good for layering.
1965,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Like them. It‚Äôs definitely a stretchy material. I‚Äôm a tall and thick woman. I weigh about 250 and I got XL.
1966,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"It is a very comfortable sweater. Hood is a good size, not too small. I bought this bright shirt for construction work. I like my sweatshirts a little roomie. This is perfect."
1967,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,thumbs up comfortable!
1968,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great Product I've got two of them.  They work great for hunting.
1969,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Excellent product Good product good price
1970,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Solid leggings A lot of people compare these to the Gymshark vital seamless leggings, and since that's my favorite line I wanted to try these out. They're similar in appearance but not so much fit or material. They're about a half size larger than Gymshark sizing and have less compression. The material is a bit thinner as well and the waistband doesn't bring you in as tight. That said, these are still great leggings. I'm keeping my pair for sure because these are good on their own - but I wouldn't say these are a dupe"
1971,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Good quality big runs big
1972,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Quality I was very happy with this product. It is very well made and I am very pleased with this purchase.
1973,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Super comfortable! Great joggers! The fabric is perfect for summer
1974,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Like it! I usually wear xsmall, but I got a small and it fits well. I usually like my workout clothes a little looser, so I might try a medium next time. Other than the love the material of the shirt"
1975,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice purchase Like it
1976,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Nice material Fit well, nice material, will buy again"
1977,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfect in every way!!! Perfect length, cut, and drape! üî•"

1979,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cute, comfortable, and light. This is a cute dress and comfortable. It fits closely enough to flatter, but it doesn‚Äôt cling. The fit is perfect for me!"
1980,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Value This hoodie has held up great.  My husband uses it to work in, wears it everyday its cold (Nov.-March) and it lasted for over a year!"
1981,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Warm and comfortable.fits true to size‚ù§
1982,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love tou guys Love it so much
1983,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Absolutely love the fit and fabric! These are my favorite bottoms of all times!  I might own at least 10 pair between the joggers and the capris in this same style. Now, I wish they made them in just a regular hemmed bottom. That would be amazing! I would probably own one in every color then!"
1984,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Def Recommend Worked perfectly for working out in my cold garage gym. Kept me warm enough but did not overheat me. Perfect for what I wanted! The fit is also very flattering.
1985,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Just okay Shirts were on the shorter side.
1986,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,üëçüèª Love these!
1987,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Just what I wanted Very comfortable, big - but what I expected! Loose and flowy!"
1988,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfort Love them
1989,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Extremely comfortable Such a comfort and lightweight but solid with ease and no binding. Just right, the most comfortable I have found. And affordable for me."
1990,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Size up Normally i‚Äôm a medium, but after reading the reviews and not wanting to wear these super tight, i got them in XL, and i love them. As a PE teacher, these are heaven sent !"
1991,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great! It is very comfortable and in love the pockets. Definitely a great summer dress. However the top is very low, that's why I only have it 4 stars. I am 5ft tall and am about 130. The small fit just right. Also the front of the dress is a little shorter than the back. Which is great for for me since I am short"
1992,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect easy gifts for associates Brought this product for associates as a holiday gift from their employer. Associates love them, nice and warm! All we did was added the embroidered the company's logo on the hoodies."
1993,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Love wearing these as undershirts.
1994,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very Warm At first sight, the sweatshirt struck me as a little thin, but it is VERY warm. It generally fits as expected, but I find it constricting across the back/shoulders."
1995,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"2nd time ordering, perfect! Perfect for the gym! I ordered 2 pairs but different colors."
1996,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Definitely compression... I usually wear medium tops, but I gained some weight so I ordered up. These fit and are fitted. No guessing what‚Äôs underneath üò≤ I think I‚Äôm going to send back for a larger size because the material is right"
1997,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,True to size.. Love that this dress is short in the front and not dragging in the back. Which most long dresses do. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and ordered a medium. Perfect fit. Wish I can get in a solid color..
1998,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great fit Ordered these for work. Great material fit nicely and look flattering. The compression is definitely good. Sleeves were just the right size and the length isn‚Äôt short neither super long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù for reference and wear a medium. The white shirt is a bit see through so a white bra underneath is a must.
1999,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,feels and looks so good it is exactly what i wanted in every way i loved it so much I ordered another one. I wear sweat shirts daily and to me this is a perfect fit in every way deserves 10 stars
2000,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good price and warm Purchased these when they were on sale for work and bought one in every color.
2001,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very Pleased Well made and comfortable. I bought both a large and an Large X for my husband, who usually wears a size medium sweater. I purposely bought them large because he wanted them to fit very loose and the XLG is big on him, but he likes it. I've washed them and there was no shrinkage of dye running. Nice sweatshirts and I would buy them again."
2002,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Great item! Warm, comfortable, well constructed, just what I had hoped for although I had wanted to get it in my college color(s).  Definitely worth the price."
2003,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Just what I was looking for I love the way it feels on and also the way it fits. You can workout in it but also go do errands or whatever and still look good doing it. And top it all off the value is great too. Well worth it I'll be getting all the colors
2004,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Runs slightly big, overall cute sundress I think this runs just a bit on the big side. I usually wear a 4-6 dress and the small seemed big, especially in the torso. Length was good, I liked that the straps are adjustable. It bunches just a tad at where the straps attach to the dress, which is why I have it 4/5 stars."
2005,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good product; buy at least one size larger than usual My son originally balked when he saw the XXL tag but when he tried the tank on it was very snug. If these hold up well I will definitely buy more of them.
2006,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good sweat shirt I bought these as a casual shirt for when cold weather hit.  They are warm and fit a little large, which is how I like my shirts to fit.  These shirts are on par with other Russel apparel I have purchased in the past."
2007,5,B009R09Z8W,1,üëç üëç
2008,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Recommend Very good ! I tried to upload a pic of me bending down so you could see that it isn‚Äôt very transparent. They run small definitely go a size up. I‚Äôm usually a medium in most things I ordered a large in both the shirt and leggings
2009,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great price Good value and price.
2010,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good fit, good product Love these tanks! I'm 5'10, 155 lbs, 34 c/d, ordered size Medium and they fit perfectly. Skin tight (not uncomfortably tight), very flattering cut, long enough even on a tall frame. The material is thin and stretchy. I wore one today to a circuit training class, and then as a base-layer for a six-mile run in the rain. Zero complaints for either activity, and kept me warm while hanging out at the bar in wet run clothes.<br /><br />I only wish they came in more fun colors. I would buy the heck out of a set that included lime green, pink, and a lighter/brighter shade of blue or purple."
2011,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Excellent sweatshirt üëå Great fit, color and exactly what the husband wants.  I am ordering more colors for both of us."
2012,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Amazing fit!! Love these so much. Petite and fitted to my size. Ordered 1 and repurchased another color.
2013,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Soft and comfortable I like them there soft and comfortable

2016,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fit good Love these
2017,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"As advertised The product as advertised. I wish the stitches match the shirt color, but it still works for my work environment."
2018,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,NEW FAVORITE LEGGINGS! I am ordering more colors asap. They fit perfectly and are so fricking flattering. I bought a medium in the merl blue shade just to be safe as I vary between medium and small with leggings and I didn‚Äôt want the waist band to squeeze to tight on my tummy. I would recommend these to anyone!
2019,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I love these Russel sweatshirts I love these Russel sweatshirts; soft and comfy inside and out and nice range of colors. Fits as expected, order correct and on time"
2020,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"tight thru chest its really cute! i like that the straps are adjustable. I am 5 ft 3 and 130 lbs but wear a 36DD with lots of cleavage. TMI- sorry!<br />the medium length is great but it is a light tight thru the chest. the adjustable straps make it to where my cleavage is covered. I think the large would be too big, so I am going to stick with the medium and wear a bralette under."
2021,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product The fit is great
2022,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Nice What I expected. I will buy more
2023,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,I like the tanks It fits perfectly on my medium built body but it has a con: not thick enough like cotton to absorb my sweat.
2024,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Very comfortable! I ordered these in the teal and the sanddrift print. I got a large accourding to the measurement chart. The teal fit great, the waistband does slide a bit over time but they are very comfortable. I did have to wash them before I wore them because they smelled like vinegar. The sanddrift were weirdly large everywhere. I returned them"
2025,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfy and light,  not tight There is light compression so I don‚Äôt feel I have to wear a bra! The lighter colors are more see-thru but the black is perfect on its own. The material is still breathable."

2044,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Super comfy and flattering They are comfy and look the best with sandals in my opinion.
2045,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Well Made Import The less expensive clothing is on Amazon, it's more likely to not fit US standard sizes.  This one is true to sizing.  Well-made and a quality sweatshirt.  Beautiful bright red color."
2046,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Great b This is a very nice dress that can be worn much of the year. It‚Äôs very pretty for fall and winter with tights and booties or high boots. The colors are vibrant, the material is soft And the fit was good. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù1 and it‚Äôs just a little long for me, hitting just at the knee. It is worth the very reasonable price."
2047,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"It looks and feels good, but somewhat small. It looks and feels good, but somewhat small."

2056,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Good enough product I realize I‚Äôm a female and it‚Äôs a mens shirt, but it runs a little large for an xs.  It fits more like a small."
2057,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Everyone says ""too large"", but mine shrank. This is easily my favorite sweatshirt.  It's warm and comfy.  But I normally wear an extra-large size, and reviewers say order a size smaller.  I ordered the large size, and when mine arrived, it was a bit large.  After three washings, it got down to where it is now a bit snug.  I ordered a Gilban sweatshirt at the same time.  It is lighter weight, but did not shrink like the Russell.  In conclusion, I say consider whether you intend to use a dryer, or hang it out.  If you use a dryer, expect shrinkage."
2058,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Runs small I am typically  S-M size,  I ordered M-size but it's small for me. The length is good, the colors and fabric are great! It's stretchy.  It's comfortable to my skin. I like it so I ended up returning it and got the L- size. Overall it's a great product for workout!"

2082,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Tight in the chest I was surprised to find that the medium was tight for my modest size 38 chest. Because of this it doesn't lay flat in the underarm area. I like it, though and might buy another in a large."

2094,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"perfection This is a staple in my fall wardrobe. And I'm loving this super soft sweatshirt. The color is a true deep burgundy and the quality of this shirt is superb. I'd highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to add a super comfortable ,well made easy to wear shirt to their closet"
2095,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Waist is a little snug on the medium size Love the feel of the fabric
2096,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Perfect little dress This was exactly what I wanted. I had some knee high socks that I wanted to pair with boots and a dress and this fit the bill. I'm 5'9"", 180 pounds with size 38G boobs and hips. I'm an hour glass figure....his dress did not make me look wide all the way down nor did I feel like I was wearing a tent. It was actually flattering. I have difficulty wearing things like this but this dress was on point. So glad I got it!!"

2098,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Really Great Leggings These look great and they're super comfortable. Might be my favorite legging brand. Lots of colors to choose from as well!  I bought a Medium btw.
2099,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"üòÅ Made very well, washes good, nice colors, great for semi- cold temps."
2100,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Quality as advertised. fits fine loose fit is great breaths better that way.  I was looking for a seriously casual Christmas Suit this is it.
2101,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Meets Expectations The shirt is comfortable, warm, can be worn separately or underneath a heavier garment, and meets all expectations."
2102,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Great Hoodie! Was looking for a sweatshirt that was warm but not to bulky and I found it! They are super soft on the inside and hold up great when washed. Obviously this is listed as a men‚Äôs shirt but I still love the fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 160lbs, a large was great for wearing with leggings and keeping my butt covered plus then I can pull my hands in the sleeves when I‚Äôm cold. Have ordered 2 different colors and may order a third in a size smaller for a better looking fit."
2103,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Loose but comfortable These are great workout shirts. They aren't tight, but they are comfortable for working out and running. Something with a little more compression might have been nice, but that's okay."

2105,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Super cute & unique This dress is adorable. My daughter loves it & gets compliments on it a lot!
2106,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"TRUE TO SIZE! True to size! I made the mistake of ordering one size down from my normal M to a size S based on some of the reviews. I maybe could get away with it but the sleeves are just barely long enough and if it shrinks (it is half polyester, half cotton) it will no longer be adequate. The waistband rides up and becomes shorter so I will order a medium. Quality seems fine but I haven't worn and washed it yet obviously."
2107,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,It‚Äôs very comfortable Casual wear
2108,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Nice Itching before first wash
2109,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Five Stars Love these tops. This is my second order.
2110,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,I would be these again. Good quality. Good sewing and materials used.
2111,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Excellent for Running in the Summer or Races With 1 Small Flaw If you have the athletic build to fit in these or are a runner in decent shape, these will fit great.  I have no issues with the fit.  However, being 6'0""+, these could be 1-2"" longer so they look better overall for taller people and don't sit at the waist.  I prefer running shirts to be slightly below the waist so they don't ride up.  They are tapered so the back does sit somewhat lower than the sides do.  As for breathe-ability, these work, but I haven't seen a single top that doesn't soak up sweat on the very hot days.  Like other tank tops, I will soak through these on 90F+ days and on runs of several miles.  Overall, these are a cool design and look sharp whether out on the track or doing longer runs around the neighborhood.  I would use these on race day if the weather calls for it too."
2112,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"OK value Wears like a coat, thick and warm, a great value. I have a 37 inch sleeve the xxl  covered my wrists. Wow a yr later ( bought another one ) and how thin and lightweight the material has gotten, yea it fits but wow."
2113,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"size up I listened to reviews and sized up, glad I did. Definitely runs small! Comfy and good for working out, not sure they will last the test of time but we shall see!"
2114,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Big pockets! Great style-don‚Äôt like high waisted so this is perfect! These are a great fit with pockets that don‚Äôt bulge out. Very comfortable for in or out. I have bought 5 or 6 of these-different colors! They‚Äôre warm but not bulky.
2115,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice material, thanks for the hoodie So far, it's a perfect fit for the man I bought it for.  Thanks!"

2119,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Nice Shirts I like the lightweight material.  I'm 5-10 175#, ordered Medium and it fits good.  Slightly loose, not stretched like compression clothing.  Very nice shirts for the gym."
2120,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,But overall not bad! It's a little larger then I expected. But overall not bad!
2121,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits a little snug Fits a little snug but very comfortable.
2122,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"comfort fitting Appears to be of good quality. I purchased XL, has a snug fit but not too tight like a compression shirt.  If you want compression then you should go for a smaller size."
2123,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Comfy Super cozy and comfortable. Perfect length to wear as a school teacher with some leggings underneath.
2124,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good fit I use in gym
2125,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comparable to the Russell Heavyweight sweatshirts of the past About the same weight as the Heavy Weight sweatshirts from the 80's & 90's.  Hopefully it will hold up like my old ones (some are from the 80's and still going strong).  Very good fit -- not too tight or too baggy.  Did not seem to shrink at all after a wash & dry.
2126,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Beautiful casual dress Beautiful color, well made and super happy with my purchase"
2127,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Fitting snug and comfy. I love this. These are officially my favorite new workout shirts. I love the air flow in them, and they fit really amazingly."

2138,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars Great quality, however, size was bigger than expected, so I recommend ordering down a size."

2148,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable and soft Love the fit, feel and comfort, but like all the others, it rides up. Ah, well, none are perfect."

2152,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"The Great Dilemma I have worn these sweatshirts for years...Russell, the manufacturer, seems in the last two or<br /> three years to have changed the styling.<br /><br />I tried the Medium...too large...tried the Small...too tight across the body...decided to take the<br />Medium and so it goes....They are comfortable..they wash easily...keep their color and I<br />will enjoy it."
2153,5,B09M6X79V9,1,comfy and helped keep things in place comfy and helped keep things in place while woirking out.
2154,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Order your original size it runs a little big. So don't size up. I ordered this for my husband who is 6 foot with a long tarsal so most sweatshirts end up being too short or ride up. Not these he loves them and they look so nice and wash great.

2159,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Just buy them! These are soooo flattering and comfortable. I need all the colors! I can‚Äôt say how they are for working out as I purchased them to lounge and run errands in. I have a very similar pair from Old Navy that were twice the price but these are softer and available in so many more color options. Highly recommend.

2185,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"The perfect sweatshirt! This a great quality sweatshirt and is exactly what I was looking for! Fits perfect, looks and feels great!"
2186,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"I love these shirts! I love these shirts! I'm 6' 210 and wear a size large tee but ordered a Medium here because I wanted the extra compression. The medium fits tighter, but the length is still good.<br />Lost a lot of weight in the past and have some loose skin to contend with, these shirts do the job. Exactly what I needed, and the best price I've found for a compression shirt of this quality. Will definitely order again!"
2187,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Nice shirts for the money I do enjoy these, they came in just before my workout time. It fits a bit snug in the chest but not to the point of discomfort, I actually like the fit. It is very breathable and comfortable. I guess if there was any complaint it would be the smell when I sweat, wait no, that's me ü§£ü§£ got to have some humor<br />I am disabled so use my arms for everything from regular wheelchair, racing wheelchair, and handcycle so I have bigger arms and chest than most."
2188,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Love! My sons and nephews loved these workout shirts! They are light and easy to workout in.

2194,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Compression? I don't know about compression, but these are the PERFECT work out tops if you are looking for a slim fit that does not move and tucks really well (stays in place and doesn't bunch in all the wrong places). Great material, soft but cool and moisture wicking."
2195,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Love the product I like the product but wish I would have bought a size smaller. Because it doesn't really compress my stomach. But good for working out.
2196,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Four Stars The shirts fit great! They are a little shorter than I would like, but still a good product."

Unlike my racerbacks that cinch in exposing my nipples or stretch during my session, these fit exactly how I want the entire set."
2206,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Order your normal size Took others advice and ordered a size smaller.. big mistake

2215,4,B09M6X79V9,1,X-Lg fit is comparable to Lg. I wanted these for the gym. The fit is too tight so I'm giving them away. Don't order if you want/need an X-Lg.

2219,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Really like this lightweight shirt... I lost a few pounds this spring and summer and wanted to show my weight reduction alittle.  I use this shirt to exercise and go for my long walks and they are very comfortable.  Great to wear for my long walks because they aren't heavy like a normal sweatshirt and keep me cool on those hot evening  walks.  When the sun is hot on my head, I can pull the hoodie and keep my head cool.  Love the shirt."
2220,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Good fit I'm a big guy at 5 foot 10 and 250lbs and ordered XXL and they fit perfectly. Not snug at all, a nice loose fit."
2221,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Get it in every color! Same review as I bought two different colors in two different sizes. A little shear so it likely see-thru in sunlight so mind the color of your undergarments. Otherwise, great dress for the price. And it has POCKETS!!! Not much different in sizing between the Med and Large. I purchased both in different colors and keeping them."
2222,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great Shirt! I got the white tank and I really like it. It feels good amd does a great job keeping me cool amd staying tucked in. I had to go one size up which did not bug me. Good thing thing I measured my chest beforehand.
2223,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"fits me perfect. Got the size small, I'm 5'6&#34; and 130lb female, fits me perfect."
2224,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great Shirt I like these shirts; I ordered a pair of three, than re order some additional colors, extremely comfortable.  I wear them at night with shorts to sleep in."

2227,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"So far so good, it appears to be well made So far so good, it appears to be well made.  The real test will be after it has been washed a couple times.  I bought because of the Russell brand.  Years ago it was a well respected brand. Hope it still is."
2228,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice and warm Nice and warm, but a little baggy. I'm 5'11&#34; (180cm), size M and sleeves are perfect, it fits perfectly in the shoulders, but in the lower body it's loose. So if you don't have a noticeable belly and don't like loose fit, you might consider buying something else."
2229,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Fits perfectly Fits perfectly
2230,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"colors stay bright a long time soft slightly oversized sweatshirt, bright colors have stayed bright through several (cold water) laundry cycles -- once of the favorite sweatshirts around here"
2231,4,B009R09Z8W,1,okay item okay.
2232,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very comfortable So comfortable, and very high quality"
2233,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,They fit good but would have preferred them a little Would have gotten large but was not available. They fit good but would have preferred them a little tighter
2234,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars bought one...ordered another
2235,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Comfy but the shirts roll up while running Great fabric and fit. Not great while working out. The shirt kept rolling up from the bottom.<br />Disappointed.
2236,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Comfortable, breathable and durable Perfect for use as an undershirt or simply a workout shirt. Medium will be snug but comfortable for anyone 5‚Äô 8‚Äù and about 180lbs."
2237,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Fit well Like the fit . Not too loose and length is just right.
2238,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect Russell is one of the finest brands for sweat gear, and I have been buying their clothing for many years, and have never been disappointed...They wash extremely well too"
2239,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great undershirt I got these to wear under scrubs now that it's getting colder out. That's the only thing I've used them for so I don't know how they hold up for working out in but I'm in the ER so I'm moving around for a solid 12 hours at a time and they've done just fine. They're lightweight and a comfortable enough material that I don't get too hot in. I ordered a L based off others reviews and it ended up being the perfect size (form fitting enough I can wear under my uniform but not too tight).
2240,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Super cute! I like wearing it with a belt and jean jacket. Very springy.
2241,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Love it These fit perfectly would definitely buy more
2242,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice tops My only complaint is that I got sunburned thru the top in a short time. It made me feel like I was on fire when out in direct sun. Otherwise it‚Äôs very comfortable
2243,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great cost - fabulous price I bought this for a undershirt for my thin clothing. It works great and fits fantastic.
2244,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love Love! Great fit. So soft and comfy!
2245,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Perfect for fall Comfortable and perfect look with booties or boots. Very comfortable
2246,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Tanks Fits great
2247,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Value Sweatshirt I love Russell products and they are difficult to find in many stores (they push some cheaper brands). When I found them on Amazon I was thrilled.  Highly recommend this hooded sweatshirt. Its well made and warm.  Best of all you get a large selection of colors and sizes at Amazon without having to sort through stacks of inventory.
2248,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Real comfortable sweatshirt but arms are very baggy.
2249,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,". shirt material was heavier than expected, otherwise okay"
2250,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Cute but too small. I‚Äôm a medium in all of my Amazon leggings but these felt very small on me. They are beautiful leggings so I may just exchange the size.
2251,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Great fit Love it perfect size
2252,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Super great!! Amazing fit, not see through, don‚Äôt fall even while working out"
2253,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"loved them so much i bought another set. loved them so much i bought another set. i bought them bigger  but they fit the way they should, they dont cut into me at all and after havinglost a ton of weight, i need a little compression, but i like to breathe."
2254,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Five Stars I just love it
2255,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Comfortable These are really cute leggings and very comfortable my only problem was that I ordered based off of the size chart since I know my measurements but the leggings are too big an XS would have fit much better.
2256,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Good quality for the price. I am very pleased with this item. It keeps me cool and is very comfortable. I forget I am even wearing it under my work shirt.
2257,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great shirt Working out
2258,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Just what I needed for those cold nights. Nice quality and fit great!
2259,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Nice tanks for a good price These are very comfortable tanks. I use them for lifting as well as during yoga. They are very light weight. Sizing is good. They are not as tight as other compression tanks. They wick sweat well and dry quickly.
2260,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,I would recommend product The product quality is great and the product looks very nice and delivery was quick.  It is best to get several packs of this product you will not go wrong.

2263,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"I love them After reading the reviews I decided to get an x-small, normally I go with a small. I am 5‚Äô3, 120 pounds. They fit great, I‚Äôm glad I sized down! They seem relatively squat proof but I would recommend wearing seamless underwear with them. They are also sweat proof, I did a CycleBar class in them and you could not see one drop of sweat. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"
2264,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Exact GymShark dupes! These are exact duplicates to gym sharks vital seamless. And for half the price! They fit perfect, very stretchy, squat proof, and they don‚Äôt fade.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 135-145 an. Mediums fot perfect. I have ordered so many and will never buy gym shark again!"

2267,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Nice fit Colors are true to picture and they are fitting to the body.
2268,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Cut very small The shirts are comfortable, but they're cut extra small. I usually wear a medium-large. I ordered a two X just to be safe since I don't order offline much, and they fit like a medium-large."
2269,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,Cute shirt Cute shirt and fine for what u pay for it . I am 5.6 124 lbs and got a xs and it was still a tad baggy but also short lol. But it‚Äôs still cute and super comfy and breathable for a hot day at the gym .

2277,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Comfortable and look nice. These are so comfy. Fits just right and look awesome. I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars cuz the pink is slightly translucent and I can see my bra under it but other than that I love these. I‚Äôm gonna order more I‚Äôm sure.
2278,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great price Used this product for use under work shirts. Gives a clean look under scrubs while still keeping you warm.
2279,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"kinda like mesh, really light weight, got black not see thru. VERY NICE ESP FOR PRICE im 5ft 4 and got XS, kinda built already so fit perfect! not too loose not too small, just right fit. 5 ft 4 132lbs if that helps"
2280,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Comfy These are super comfy but i wish the top was more tummy controlled
2281,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,buy an extra size larger  if you use a drier I took the advice of the Amazon reviewers and bought a L but I should have bought an XL. It fits perfectly but I am afraid to put it in the drier<br />Otherwise good quality

2285,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Buy the 3 pack. Love it. I'm petite and I was concerned that with the loose style of this top it would fall off of me while working out. It fits well.  I wish I would have bought the 3 pack.
2286,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"best tank top! This is my new favorite shirt to workout in. It isn't too baggy, but is just loose enough around the stomach area. I am 5'4&#34; and 135lbs. Got the Small and am going to order more colors."

2314,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Fit nice I like this too the look n feel going to see how it lasts with wash and wear
2315,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Would recommend Nice shirt but size down if you want a lot of compression. They are soft and comfy but on the loose side.
2316,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Worth the price I really like how these joggers feel and fit. The texture of them is very smooth, but the one downside is that I have noticed slight pilling after a few wears. The fit is exactly what I was looking for. I am 5'2 and 100 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. They are tighter fitting sweatpants, but I really like that. Not super warm so if you are looking for thick sweatpants these may not be right for you."
2317,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Perfect. As described Adorable dress and quality. My girls love them!

Absolutely love these sweatpants.<br />Definitely buying some for my Baby Girls (41yrs&40yrs).<br />Love the extra wide waist. With drawstring- -  and the pant goes with anything!! You can dress it up or dress it down.<br />Roll up the leg to the calf keep it messy looking add a white tank set of pearls-( necklace, earrings, bracelet, pearl look-a-like) stilettos and a leather.  And you have a perfect outfit."
2323,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Amazing fit This product was an amazing deal!  It fits really comfortably and makes me look slimmer.  It also absorbs sweat really well.
2324,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,my husband likes it better than his original one purchased as a replacement for an older version of the same item; my husband likes it better than his original one.
2325,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Wonderful  gym attire just right fit. Amazing  gym wear or just out and about wear
2326,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,... its only the tank top anyway wore it and excellent!! Thank you looking at the picture I thought it was a short and shirt but its only the tank top anyway wore it and excellent!!!
2327,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fit as expected it I love it it doesn‚Äôt itch I have a delicately Skin so to me was not a problem at all I use it to work out and sometimes as undershirt it makes you look fit though üòéüëçüèª

2331,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Joe's Hoodie Beautiful light pink hoodie, light-weight, packaged well,  & arrived in a timely manner."
2332,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very Warm, Worth The Price People mentioned how warm this jacket was, and I thought really how warm could a sweatshirt be. But seriously, something is going on with this thing--super warm. So that's a real thing.<br /><br />Otherwise, great sweatshirt/jacket. Fit is a little more on the loose side, less of a trim fit, which is what I was looking for.<br /><br />Two downsides: the hood string is suuuuuuper long (why is it so long??), and the polyester in the jacket does cause some pilling. Neither of these is the end of the world."

2343,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Fits great & true to size in my opinion This tank is awesome & fits great! . I ordered a medium (5‚Äô2‚Äù, 140/athletic build) and it fits me perfect.  I ordered a medium, I received a medium. I think in previous comments, the people looked at the European size?? & not USA. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm loving this tank. I wanted something to use for laying tanks. It fits under the armpits great & just an overall great fit. Very soft & moisture wicking. I would buy again! Love."
2344,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love this so much I love this dress so much. Got a size large might go medium next time. I‚Äôm 194lbs and a 10/12
2345,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Would order again in more unique colors Love em. The hood is perfect size. Right size across the chest and then loose around the core. Wish they were in more colors
2346,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Spots, hold onto them Stylish and classy"
2347,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Good tank I like these tanks for lounging around.  Unfortunately I did receive 1 with a little hole under the arm on the seam.  That was too bad.  Flattering cut and all around good tank.  I would recommend for the price.
2348,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Really awesome hoodie! Nice and thick. Perfect fit. Perfect hoodie honestly.
2349,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars supper nice
2350,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice material Very nice material. Its a little heavier than I thought but I am happy with that as I work in a cold environment.

My height is 5‚Äô5, my weight is 127 and I ordered small. They fit perfectly and the material is soft and stretchy. I definitely recommend. told 3 of my friends about them and they ordered 2 pairs already."
2356,5,B09M6X79V9,1,I use these as under shirts for work. The three different colors go with a wide selection of my dress shirts.

2359,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars Nice hoodie, very comfortable"
2360,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Better than much more expensive sweatshirts I bought two more of these after my husband had one for over a year and I was impressed at how well it was holding up washing after washing. Better than much more expensive sweatshirts. And, the side panels give a great fit. It really is the perfect sweatshirt. Plus, it comes in a lot of great colors. Super duper!"
2361,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Comfortable but still dressy Great fit! Light material. I washed and dried to shrink up a little bit and also followed another reviewers advice and moved the halter tie to the back. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 135 lb and small fits nicely but would have liked a tighter fit at the waist.

2368,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Amazing 12/10 would recommend These are excellent I would recommend them to everyone. I sweat and they wick it. They flatter and firm. They are thick enough to be flattering and opaque but still feel extremely light. I am a D cup and I wear these around the house without a bra and feel decent and comfortable. I‚Äôd buy ten if I could.
2369,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,So comfortable! Have not worn them for yoga yet but I just tried them on and they fit great and suck everything in without making me feel like I have to squeeze myself in them. Even my hip dips aren't as notieable!

2372,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Size down I like the color and material I‚Äôm usually a small in most yoga pants and leggings so I ordered a small, but I get some sort of cameltoe I think I ordered a size too big. Next time I‚Äôll order an extra small and see how that fits."

2384,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love the dress. I really love this dress. My only complaint is, it fits kinda small at the chest area. I wore it to a cookout & I received a lot of compliments. It rained & the dress got pretty wet, but the red didn‚Äôt bleed into the white dots. I plan on purchasing different colors."
2385,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Great fit
2386,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great stuff I am into my comfort and refuse to wear anything with a logo or name on it... if they want me to advertise for them it had better be free. These are exceptionally comfortable and wear them all the time.
2387,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Looks good and priced right If you‚Äôre looking for compression tank tops that look good and are a great price these are it. I will definitely buy more.

2392,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,LOVE IT I‚Äôm so happy that this was exactly what I wanted. The oversized fit and the color! I ordered an XL for it to be really oversized. And the color is like a burnt orange. Very comfy!!
2393,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great workout shirts Very comfortable
2394,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Great fit and good quality.
2395,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love Love these shirts. They are comfortable and cute and they stay in place. Not really compression but fitted.
2396,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfort and Value Perfect for long hours at home.  Excellent value.
2397,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"lightweight I use this for a pajama top.  It is perfect, doesn't bunch up and is warm.  Fits nicely at wrist with the stretchy cuffs, and feels soft.  Meets all my expectations.  Probably a great weight for summer wear, but.  Looks really nice."
2398,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great buy Comfortable
2399,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Not too bad I bought these for my bf for the gym. They are super great! I only gave 4 stars because they snag easily or the material can lose threads quickly. But he has worn them a lot and they have stood up to constant washing. They also make those back muscles stand out!
2400,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"4 out of 5 Overall I like it. Im 5‚Äô2 130lbs and size Small fits just right.<br />The ONLY item that bothers me is the plastic adjustment right behind the straps? They‚Äôre not as smooth, quite a bit rough so its a bit uncomfy I keep scratching my back."
2401,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very Well Made Beautiful color, warm and well-made"
2402,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Would buy another one. These are great for working out. Stretch enough to me comfortable and also tight enough to keep everything in place. I ordered size L even tho I‚Äôm usually a size M. I feel like these will fit me way after losing al the weight I will. They seem to be good quality fabric.
2403,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"great quality and as comfortable as I wished for on ... Fits perfectly, great quality and as comfortable as I wished for on this old body. Thank you !"
2404,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love it. Very comfortable. Not the same as one that I've had for several years. The cuffs are falling off that one. 17 yrs later
2405,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Very attractive. These are very attractive, they fit nicely but buy at least the size you wear or one bigger. My wife likes them and looks great wearing them."
2406,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Super comfy What I wanted
2407,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great Got here on time, this not first order, still great quality and fits perfectly"

2409,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product! Medium is my range of a perfect fit.
2410,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Beautiful dress Um 6' tall, so I wish they offered a tall length.  But it's gorgeous and flowy and I love it"
2411,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Four Stars Way too small and my 15 yr old always wears women's small size. Fast delivery tho
2412,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great for the gym
2413,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Good fit Love these shirts! They fit perfectly and are not too tight. They also dry quickly after a workout.
2414,4,B09M6X79V9,1,After wearing this once - shirt trim ripped and is no longer wearable [[VIDEOID:edef316e1da9b9dfd26065f9e49d8f84]] The trim And fit is what I liked the most AND it is what ripped off as well ‚Ä¶<br />Pooor quality<br />Money back would be great - but past the date - I wanted too long to actually wear it
2415,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"fits small, but otherwise a good product, & no camel toe I usually wear a large in leggings, but I had to go up to extra large & even that is a bit tight. However, for the major feature I was looking for, a camel-toe free legging, these work great."
2416,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sizes are too big on some items and too small on others A little on the large side
2417,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Good fit Good shirt for working out.
2418,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"perfectly snug I got these to wear under my scrubs and they fit on my body nice. I think the sizing is like right on the border, i got large and they fit but i feel like an xl could be good too. light weight feel, keeps the moisture at bay, stretchy material so they fit snug but not extreme tight."
2419,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great quality for your money ! Great shirts, very light, quick dry material, love the fit, very comfortable.  Great price !  Three shirts for less than the cost of other ‚ÄúName‚Äù athletic wear.  If you‚Äôre not hung up about wearing only UA, Nike, etc. these are comparable quality at a much more reasonable price.  Not made in America if that‚Äôs an issue."
2420,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"I love this hoodie. :) At first, I wasn't sure whether to buy the Hanes hoodie or take a chance with this brand, so I got both and I gotta say I definitely prefer this one over the other. I got the maroon color which is a first for me but it's soft, true to color, and it fits nicely. The other one was too warm and didn't feel right, very happy with this purchase."
2421,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Awesome workout tank Great fit and material
2422,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Very comfortable and good price.  I am very pleased with this product. A VERY COMFORTABLE ITEM OF CLOTHING.  NICE COLOR, GOOD FIT.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE."
2423,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Very Comfortable They're comfortable.  Work well for both fashion and exercising.
2424,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Thanks Thanks
2425,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Comfy & Cozy I got an XXL and it‚Äôs big and baggy just like I wanted it to be. The material is so soft and comfy. It‚Äôs a little thin but that‚Äôs great because I want to wear it under jackets anyways. I‚Äôm between an XL-1X. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 230 pounds so it‚Äôs a little longer but it‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for!
2426,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Super cute and comfy Love these joggers. They comfy, cool and super stretchy. I thought these would fit a little looser but I‚Äôm not unhappy that they don‚Äôt. They are as tight as leggings but definitely more fitted than I thought they would be. Super flattering. I‚Äôm about a 14, long legs, large rear end and I bought an XL."
2427,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"These are my new favorite gym tanks The quality is great for the price, and the price is essential as someone who needs enough tanks for 10-15 gym days between washes. It did take some time to figure out the right fit. If you want these really compression-wear skin-tight, then they're basically true to size; but I just wear them as gym tanks so buying a size up (I usually wear a Small but Mediums fit just right) works best."
2428,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,It looks good Good shirt. Worth the money.
2429,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,You‚Äôll like it Great Sweatshirt!
2430,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars LOOKS GREAT AND FITS CORRECT
2431,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,gift This was on recipient's gift list.  Very pleased when he opened present.  Received well packed and on time for Christmas.
2432,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Bright green hoodie I love this...it's large, but I wanted it that way. Now it's a matter of keeping it away from the husband. He works construction and wears this color. He always steals the hoodies and ruins them!!"
2433,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfy af Big fan. Nice comfy and durable. Fast shipping as well. Russell hasn‚Äôt let me down yet!
2434,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great fit For perfectly and comfortable for working out! I don‚Äôt use these to go out or anything. Just the gym.<br />Size small 120lbs 5‚Äô4
2435,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"If this one wears like the other one I ordered this based on one I already had.  The sleeves are a little long, but, otherwise the fit is as expected.  Granted, my old one was several years old and had been washed many many times (which could account for the sleeves being shorter).<br />If this one wears like the other one, I will be very happy."
2436,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,very soft and fit good. These tank tops are way more comfortable that other cheaper brands. I would keep buying these as needed. very soft undershirts and well made. I got no complaints. the fit is good.
2437,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Was delivery on time n good wuality
2438,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love Love these. So comfy and look great.
2439,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Excellent Excellent
2440,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fit perfectly They look great on. They fit perfectly. They are very comfortable. They are soft on my sensitive skin. They wick away moisture very nicely.
2441,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Size up! Love these! Size up! I got a large and I usually wear medium and they‚Äôre still super tight!
2442,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"I was Skeptical... but they‚Äôre PERFECT Are you kidding me with these??? I still can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre real. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 120ish lbs and got an extra small in the dark grey color. They slid on like butter and make the booty look AMAZING. I‚Äôm about ready to buy in all colors! If you were looking for a pair of seamless leggings that you can trust, you have found them, my friend!"
2443,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Very cute This dress fit just like the pictures and the model. I'm 5'7&#34;, a size 4 and I ordered the small. It's a great length."
2444,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Buy it Now! I mean, just wow! I am shocked at how great these are!!! The short fits great and it will keep you warm while wicking away moisture. I get hot just walking around in it! They are super flattering, the material feels great, and the colors are awesome. I am most definitely ordering more! Do yourself a favor and stop spending all that money on under armour and whatnot, what you neednis right here!<br /><br />I ordered a medium, which fit perfectly. I am 5'5"", 150 lbs, 35"" bust, and 28.5"" waist."
2445,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Very nice material but buy one size SMALLER than normal Very nice light weight material; perfect for working out. I would advise buying one size smaller than you normally would. I normally wear a medium and this medium was slightly too baggy for my taste. I don't necessarily want form fitting. So I took a chance and ordered one size smaller (from medium to small) to compare and the small fitted perfectly. I'm 5'9"" about 163 lbs, and in shape. If you like your stuff a little bit baggy, then buy your normal size, of you want it to fit just right (again not tight or form fitting) then buy one size smaller than you normally would."
2446,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great value for the price. My husband ordered the shirts for his workouts. These shirts are a steal for the price. I tend to destroy workout clothes, so hate spending $20-30 a shirt. They are comfortable and allow freedom of movement. The only drawback is that they are not tapered, so it's a very boxy fit. Not the athletic cut I expected."
2447,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Beautiful dress, surprisingly good quality I love this dress. I had my eye on it at a certain clothing retailer (ahem... Venus) for the last year or so, but it was $44 there and no sales in sight.<br /><br />I was thrilled when I found it for half that on Amazon! I was a little nervous about the quality, but it's surprisingly good. I wore it on vacation over my swimsuit, and it fit well and held up over two weeks of sun and sand. I'm a happy customer!  In fact, I may end up buying it in another color as well..."
2448,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"comfortable easy fit So cute, lightweight, comfortable easy fit. My 3 year old niece is in love with this dress!!"
2449,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Fuzzy fleece What I did not expect was fuzzy fleece on inside. Nice and warm.
2450,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great top and washes great and holds up very well.  Very comfortable.
2451,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Not long like that Its cute , no where near as long as shown more of a flowy at your jean pockets an flowy up some. Hope that helps i still like it just greatly disappointed i can find the style i keep searching for , picture is very misleading!"
2452,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Outstanding workout gear Overall perfect
2453,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good solid metal zipper- comfortable relaxed fit Has a sturdy metal zipper- would have preferred a brass zipper as they self lubricate and action smoother.<br />Comfortable relaxed fit- no scrimping on the material where needed.  Is going to be my new go-to for coole weather.
2454,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"I love these! I have XL‚Äôs, just shy of 6 foot and 215 lbs.  These are so comfortable, my favorite work out/lounge pants.  Not a huge fan of the tight leggings, these are just perfect.  Have had a few pairs for a solid year and they are still in new condition"
2455,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,My favorite sweatshirts Have always loved my Russell sweatshirts! I've tried much more expensive brands but keep coming back to Russell.
2456,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"It is tight fitting, however, the material is ... It is tight fitting, however, the material is high quality and so far I've not had any problems with it while wearing them at the gym."
2457,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Quality is good for the price Ordered a medium - size 34DDD<br />Bust area is supported, overall fit is a bit tight like a sports bra. Wasn‚Äôt what I was going for but they‚Äôll work."
2458,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Very nice.
2459,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Comfortable and flattering summer dress!! LOVE!!  Dress is flattering even though it's loose fitting.  V-neck and straps add to soft, flowy look... AND... dress has POCKETS!!!  I'm 5'5"", 143 lbs, bought ""M"" and hemline sits just below ankle.  Fabric doesn't wrinkle.  Perfect - VERY pleased!!"
2460,5,B076QD9NP1,1,A Successful Gift My niece loves this dress so much and wears it all the time. Her mom says the fabric is nice.
2461,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,So comfortable!! Material similar to lululemon but a fraction of the cost! Very flattering high wasted band - perfect lounge wear or workout joggers.
2462,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Bigger than expected I liked this shirt but it was a bit larger than expected. I got the smallest size & it was still too big, making the arm-hole extra wide but it wasn‚Äôt terrible."
2463,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good value Great fit. Soft material. Look good.
2464,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fits well Feels good against the sking great for hot days
2465,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Wish they had a bigger size It's really cute and I'm glad the straps adjust, only down size is that it's still too tight around the boob area. I wear a DD and it was tight. I must wear a Bradley with this and even that, I'm not sure if it will work. Super cute though and exactly like the photo! I got a XL, wish they made a bigger size so it can accommodate big chested females. I got the green flower."
2466,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Size It fit really nice around the chest and loos e enough around the waist.  Great material and it feels very light.
2467,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell Athletics Nice sweatshirt!!!
2468,5,B09M6X79V9,1,tank top I bought these for my picky teenager. She loves them enough to ask for more. That definitely means they deserve 5 stars.
2469,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Super affordable & great quality This is a very flattering workout shirt, it is slightly thin but works to keep me cool for yoga"
2470,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Cute dress Cute dress but the color is not black.  It looks more like a dark maroon or brown.  Also there is a tie on the halter that ties on one shoulder not shown in the photo so was unexpected.
2471,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect summer dress I am so happy with this flowing flirty dress.  I purchased a large.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 165 pounds.  It fits me<br />Perfect!  Comes right to the back of my ankle and the front is slightly higher.  Very easy to walk in and right out of the bag no hemming needed.  I probably won‚Äôt put it in the dryer so it doesn‚Äôt shrink.  The pockets are great. Hidden and don‚Äôt add weight to the dress.  Perfect summer dress
2472,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Very figure flattering  if you are fit . compression fitted 5‚Äô4 125lbs bought a size small<br />  really love the  Burgundy  color of these leggings.<br />Nice quality for the price I would definitely wash separately in cold and hang dry on these !!!
2473,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fit was not right for me. Did not like the fit.

2477,5,B09M6X79V9,1,The size is real Very comfortable good quality‚Äôs
2478,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Favorite Amazon leggings so far I bought these leggings in the grey marl and light blue marl colors. I am usually a large in leggings, and the larges fit as expected. I am 5'9"" and they also reach full length on me, so if you are on the shorter side be aware you may have to roll or scrunch them. They are super stretchy, so if you are between sizes I would suggest sizing down. I don't own the Gymshark vital seamless leggings, but I own other Gymshark products and these feel of similar quality. The stitching is all high quality with no loose threads or bumpy/warped seams. The fabric is a more slick/performance material, but they are still quite soft and not too thin, scratchy, or shiny. They are also squatproof! Even the light blue color, which I thought may have issues, was totally opaque. The flexibility, comfort, and opacity of these make them great for leg days. I have been working out in my garage since the gyms have been closed and while these are long, I don't find they are too heavy or hot for the days where it's 100+ degrees Fahrenheit. Seriously, if you are wanting Gymshark-style leggings but don't want to shell out $50, give these a try. I've owned a lot of different Amazon leggings and these are by far my favorite so far!"
2479,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Sweatshirt! Sweatshirt is exactly what I expected and I have no complaints. It is classic and simple, fits true to size and has a nice warm fuzzy lining. Can't beat it for under $20!"
2480,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"it is very soft, love the inner lining I bought 2 for my husband as he works outside. I think they will wash well as I purchased the grey for when he gets them dirty! he likes them."
2481,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Would work for Minnie  mouse  costume but nothing else Don‚Äôt care for how it looked on me, pattern was a little ehh fit well though"

2491,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Super cute and comfy, runs a *little* big I wear these every day. They are a *little* big. I am usually a medium, ordered a medium, and they are a tad baggier than the baggy style they should have. I still wear them all the time. :) Enjoy!"
2492,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"almost a gymshark dupe these leggings look great!!! they're sooo flattering and so comfy and breathable. one con is that the waistband tends to roll over. I have actual gymshark leggings and i don't experience that problem with the real ones. I've worn these amazon leggings to workout twice now (one HIIT workout and one yoga) and the waistband kept rolling over for both. That might be enough reason for me to not get these in other colors... but they're just so flattering, so i keep going back and forth on it!"
2493,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice muscle shirt sizing wrong Sizes are not correct
2494,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"LOVE, but order a size down I have these in at least 5 different colors. The fit is a bit off sometimes though. I ordered my first pair in medium and it fit so well, then I ordered another in medium and it was WAY too big. Now the last three I‚Äôve gotten have been in a small and they are just a smidge too tight, but fit well otherwise. Wish the sizes were consistent because I love them."
2495,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,It is very comfortable. Even though it seem large it is flattering This is my second one.  It is very comfortable. Even though it seem large it is flattering.  I've received several compliments.

2503,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Thick and reliable These are pretty cute and reliable! They dont actually lift your butt, but theyre tight and will still make your butt look good regardless. They're not see through at all!! Very thick material. For reference, I'm usually around a size 8 to 10 in jeans and size medium fits well"
2504,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Order one size up This hoodie fit me, but if you wear a shirt underneath, buy one-size up."

2515,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfortable but not compression I really like these tank tops mostly to go under other shirts but I couldn‚Äôt wear for working out. I bought them because they say compression but they are definitely not compression although they are fitted and stretch. Even though they didn‚Äôt do exactly what I bought them for I still like them and would recommend them for general wear.

2527,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect for my workouts. Love these as an undershirt for my workouts. Helps keep the sweat away from my outer shirt (I do pretty intense krav manga workouts). And it stays in place when I'm doing mountainclimers when my outer shirts creep up. Would not wear as my only shirt.

2537,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great purchase! It's a thin fresh jersey type material, that compliments my shoulders. The hood is makes it look cool and it amps me up during my workout to zone out into the exercise. Bought this first set, and immediately purchased the other colors.<br /><br />Highly recommended! I bought XXL I'm 5'10"" 265lbs, and broad shoulders, with a Dad Bod center lol. But the fit compliments my body and feel great to wear in public."

2557,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Underscrub shirts So far I've only worn one, but they are great under scrubs. I'm 5'4 and 212lbs and the XL fits snug which is what I was looking for."

2575,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfortable but short These tops are very short. I wasn't expecting that at all. I like my tank tops to go down to my hips but these are about an inch of two above
2576,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars like the way it fits
2577,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Recommend It was perfect
2578,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great! Great!
2579,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"great sweatshirt i ordered this in a size 3xl cause i like my sweatshirts big and it fits perfectly, is super soft, and feels like good quality, definitely buying more in other colors."
2580,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Fantastic quality item Love these!!! So comfortable! Runs a bit small, get a size bigger unless you want really tight."
2581,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Comfortable and moisture wicking. My husband loves these shirts he has replaced his T-shirt that he wears under his shirts with these compression shirts.
2582,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"As advertised. So far so good. Just received this week and have worn a few times. I ordered one three pack of white and one three pack of black. As other reviewers stated the black does indeed feel like a heavier blend of the material. Strange, but true. I am about 6‚Äô1‚Äù and they are long enough for me and fit quite well as compression shirts. They wick away sweat pretty well. I‚Äôm giving these 4 stars for now only because it‚Äôs been a week and if they can hold up like my under armour I‚Äôll increase to a 5.<br /><br />One note - the white ones do have a grey stitching going through them in case someone was looking for true white."
2583,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Adorable dress for a good price! My child was so excited to get this dress! It's very cute and comfortable. The quality was good and it fits just as expected. We are very happy with our purchase!

2585,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"So Comfy I've become a dress person this summer and this is just right.  It's flowy, lite, long and super cute.  Can't go wrong for the price."
2586,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great undershirt for big guys! These shirts are great as a tight undershirt!  I'm a big guy, 5'9"", 280lb, and usually wear a 3x shirt.  I wish it was all muscle but those days are long gone so I'm writing this review for those of us who have the extra padding and want to keep it all tight.<br /><br />I ordered the 2x in these and i just ordered my 3rd package so I have enough to wear every day of the week.  They are tight but not restrictive and best of all they are long enough so they don't come out when I have them tucked.  I've had my first ones for about 3 months and they've maintained their shape and fit much better than anything else I've tried.  I recommend ordering a size smaller than your normal daily wear.  They're a tank top, with wider shoulder straps, so they don't restrict my arms or bunch up under my sleeves like a t-shirt.<br /><br />A photo? No, no, no.  Just trust me.  They'll keep your belly and other parts covered and where they need to be."
2587,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Five Stars Very soft, true to size. Daughter loves the bright colors."
2588,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,As described. My husband loved it!  We had been looking for an all black hoodie for a while.  Shopping on Amazon is so convenient!
2589,5,B09M6X79V9,1,perfect these are exactly right.
2590,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Good undershirts for scrubs I use these under my scrubs, and they work great. The sleeves are a little short for me (I like sleeves that go over my hands), but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me."
2591,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"they all fit good and was very happy with my choices Ordered 3 sweatshirts, came quick, they all fit good and was very happy with my choices."
2592,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Very comfortable Perfect material, it will act as the same as under armor or champion product or even niki with 1/3 of the price"
2593,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very nice This is a pretty nice sweatshirt. The material seems to be thick. The only thing negative was that the fit was on the large side. I normally wear lg or xlg. I ordered this one in large and it left me with ample room to grow....
2594,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Very comfortable to work out in. Very comfortable and soft. Love to wear these for my work out. Like the colors too!
2595,5,B097RFTKJP,1,It's a nice summer dress It's just right

2602,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Very warm

2605,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Well made.

2610,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I love this dress I love this dress!! I love the pockets, and the over all feel of the material! It is flowy and cool and super comfortable!! The adjustable straps make a big difference when you are small chested and they are a great feature. I am 5' 5&#34; and I ordered a small and the length was perfect for me."
2611,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Excellent Value I ordered these shirts to run in and at this price point you can't beat it. Material is good. Fit is good. Excellent shirt for overall fitness activities.

2613,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars great
2614,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,The perfect tank I bought 12 of these tanks because they are PERFECT in every way
2615,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars great quality as in all russell products
2616,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Quality Sweatshirt Bought this as a gift for my grandson who likes warm, colorful sweatshirts.  This really fits the bill!  It is a Christmas gift so haven't heard his reaction as yet but I'm sure that he will be very surprised and happy with this shirt.  It is soft and thick...a quality product."
2617,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fits The shirts are great especially for working out even if you wear them underneath another shirt. As I am still trying to lose weight I feel these shirts are great and make me feel more comfortable while I‚Äôm working out even though I do wear shirts over top of them being that I am still conscientious about my weight.
2618,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great Top I love the tops for my fitness routines. I do however, wish they had a shelf bra which I overlooked but the product is as described."
2619,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice jacket Husband likes it.
2620,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Will be buying more. I can't find these spandex type tanks anywhere.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I got the x-large for my bust size of 38D.  Will be getting more.  The price is great, the delivery time is slow because they come from overseas."
2621,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Fits maybe a little short around the sleeves and midsection but I still wear it all the time.

2627,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,VERY GOOD VERY GOOD
2628,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,It works For the most part I like this shirt. It fit as expected and is great to stay cool while working out.  The only thing I have against it is that the neck feels small and tight.  It's not on my neck at all but it does feel constricting.  I'll probably cut it to make it work better for me.
2629,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars great quality
2630,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"the fit was great, nice shirts these are very nice at this price, a little thicker than my other brands of dri fit shirts but I love them and will be definitely buying more in the future"

2635,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great gift Purchased it for my dad for Christmas, because he loves hoodies. It's so difficult for him to find other colors besides the usual black, etc. They have so many colors to choose from and the price is amazing. Plus, Russell is a great brand. He loves it because it's so warm for the winter and comfortable! Way more selection than in stores! Quickest Christmas shopping I had ever done."

2638,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,So comfy Absolutely love these! Only thing is I wish the top band was a bit bigger (longer) for better tummy control. I am 5‚Äô4 and weigh an athletic 165. I went with the mediums and feel like I should have got smalls instead. They are so soft and light weight and feel like second skin. I ordered 3 pair and plan on grabbing another pair in a smaller size! They are definitely squat proof too üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº

2652,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Perfect! These run a bit small. I ordered the XL and they fit SNUG (think compression) which is what I was looking for. If I was to wear these to the beach or out I'd probably get a XXL. But the idea was something to wear underneath my T shirt during kickboxing/MMA.<br />Nice breathable material. I'll probably order some more.

2708,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Very comfortable, works great for nursing pajamas I purchased this to use as a pajama top while nursing my newborn and also to wear under regular shirts this winter for extra warmth that I can still breastfeed in. I am quite tall and I would prefer to have the top a little bit longer but it still works fine. The bottom hem is a little snug around my mom tummy and hips but my stomach is gradually shrinking so I think this will improve. I am pretty busty and the front of the shirt just barely covers my front but it's fine for what I'm using it for.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and comfortable and I don't get sweaty/soaked when I'm sleeping.<br /><br />I would recommend this top. If you are not a fan of the racerback style, you may not like how this top is cut at the neck and back/shoulders."

He had a fit because he wanted to keep them, said they were roomy, fit over his bib overalls, and we‚Äôre not too heavy. So I bought these, and he loves them. They met all his requirements, so I was relieved and happy to be rid of his old ones!

I wear medium and it's snug around the bottom of the lats but looser around the waist. It accentuates the V shape of the back without being tight at the waist, which is perfect.<br /><br />Whatever size you wear in a regular shirt, I would go one size under. I wear large shirts but medium in these tanks. The length of the tank is still plenty long."

2780,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable Shirt in Solemn Black Product is great.  I assumed I needed a larger size by judging other name brand sweatshirts I have worn.  I was wrong.  I should have ordered 3XL instead of 4XL.  The one big draw back of mail ordering clothing whether by Internet or phone: You really should buy them in a bricks and mortar store where you can try on the items to make sure they fit well or to your comfort.  But this fits okay, albeit a bit bigly,  and I am probably better off with a larger size.  After all, it is a sweatshirt and not a dress shirt.  The quality is very good.  The color is sensational.  Nice and black and inky like a silhouette or a blackboard or a '56 Cadillac Fleetwood .  I think this sweatshirt will last me a long time.  It is so comfortable and smart looking that I may even ask to be buried in it.  I don't know what else I can say.  It's a sweatshirt; and it's comfortable.  It is well made and warm.  It is inexpensive at the discount price.  I would not hesitate to purchase it again."

2817,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Definitely A Game Changer! Neleus undershirts have taken my workouts to another level. I‚Äôm able to sustain the ultimate mobility during exercise and not worry about my undershirt riding up which is the main reason I took a chance with these. The compression is nice and the material is very comfortable. I would recommend purchasing a size smaller if you want more of a compressed fit.

2835,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Great Quality, Runs Very Small Purchased this to get a good deal on athletic shirts as ones similar to these cost around $50 each on websites like Nike and Under Armour. The quality was much better than expected and it shipped very quickly. The only criticism I have for this is that it runs EXTREMELY small. I normally wear a small in women's US sizes, but as this is Chinese sizing I ordered a large and it fits as a US small normally would. Overall, great purchase and great deal!"
2836,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"great top These are really good sports tanks. Very light, you forget you have it on. They do appear to run big though, so if you like the fit snug, go down a size from what you'd normally order."

2857,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Awesome for weight training and endurance too. Perfect fit and breathable material. I occasionally use it for studio cycling and endurance training and holds up well. Soft and thin material but still holds up during high intensity interval training.<br /><br />Compare to other icyzone athletic tops, I didn't go up a size for the shirt.

2887,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great workout shirts These are great workout shirts to include in your rotation - they are the &#34;smooth&#34; type of fabric where it's almost cool to the touch.  So I like the style - the only thing to be aware of (not a con - but an FYI) is that because these aren't cotton or a thicker fabric they don't absorb your sweat very well.  I just bring a gym towel, but if you're used to cotton you might be alarmed."

They are not see through at all, and they have a lot of compression to them!! perfect for working out and lounging! They fit true to size for me. I also have long legs and they were the perfect length with plenty of tummy control/ compression."
2939,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"How did I not know about these!! I like to be modest so I found leggings for working out that don‚Äôt show panty lines and actually look great on me! I don‚Äôt have to cover my butt with a long shirt. These look sporty, and are probably the most comfortable pair of joggers I‚Äôve ever owned. I don‚Äôt even want yoga pants anymore!"

2953,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Best Leggings Ever! I was skeptical about buying any clothes from amazon, but I saw a review on these leggings and I decided to give them a try... All I have to say is that I wish I knew about these sooner because these fit so perfect! I have a bit butt and thighs and they fit like a dream, so perfect that I have referred them to my friends and now I‚Äôm hoping the other colors don‚Äôt sell out in a large."
2954,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Cute and stretchy I ordered 2 for my kids can't land party. My mom made a vest and tie out of the second dress for my son. Stretchy material so it was a little bigger on my daughter so order a size down. I had to take it in for that slim fit. I had to put a petti coat under her dress for the dress to be puffy.

These fit perfectly keeps the sweat off my body.  I truly love these tops.  I have even gotten out on some warmer days and took my top layer off and ran just in the tank.  Highly recommend the purchase."

2969,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"They stay tucked in I really like these shirts.  They are tight and they stay tucked in, even when reaching up to the top shelf.  They are also very soft.  I recommend these over a traditional Hanes or FotL undershirt.  Note: you won't want to wear these by themselves as they will show even the smallest of love handles.  You will want a shirt over these unless you have six pack abs."
2970,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good workout shirts These shirts are a good value for the price and the fit great. Only complaint is the material seems to be a little abrasive, can cause a little skin irritation after a while. Not great but good."

I usually wear an XS and the small fits me fine.  The material is very thin and somewhat rough.  I expected the fabric to be really smooth and soft, but then again for the price I guess it's to be expected.  Also, the material is very thin and I was hoping for something a bit thicker and warmer.  If you just need some cheap basic undershirts, though, they're great and overall I'm happy with my purchase."

2991,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great gifts I ordered these as gifts. Pricing is way better then I could pay locally, and everyone is always happy for them. The color fades a tad after so many washes... But that's the way things work."

3011,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Super soft, comfy, and cute I will absolutely be buying more of these. The top is super soft, pretty large, and somehow still flattering? I love the color I purchased. It's pretty long, so I could definitely wear this over leggings and feel comfortable."
3012,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable. Good Comfortable. Good, light material. A little loose but I was hoping for a looser fit.

3019,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"great value and product these are absolutely great. as soon as one came - immediately got three more. cheap durable, fit correctly. am an xx-large / 6ft ish normal just slightly fat person, these are not poorly made or too small in some areas so they're washing well also. Big enough too that you can fudge the size a bit and heat it up to shrink if need be."
3020,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Good fit, should be perfect for the spring/summer Good product and great price for 3, less than 10 bucks a shirt"
3021,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Love the racer back I thought these were cotton tank tops but they‚Äôre more of a Lycra. I still like them.

3023,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice Nice material and colors
3024,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"not exactly ""compression"" Not as super-snug as a pair of compression shorts I own (different brand). Fits more like a rash guard, loose in the armpit. A size smaller would have fit too short for my liking. Still, it works for it's intended purpose (BJJ)."

3031,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cute little dress! My floral print Bohemian beach dress arrived on time as indicated.  I've gained weight during pandemic and needed a few new summer dresses that don't really accentuate that gain.  This dress  worked for me in doing that.  It's not ""too fitted"" at the waist so it's not too tight.  And when I lose the weight it will still work!"
3032,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Squats proof I am 5' 10"" (fit 155lb to 165lb) and they fit well. I bought these to compare to Gym Shark brand and they are almost as nice, slightly less soft, but comfy."

3039,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Best Joggers Ever!! I have ordered 2 pairs so far. They both feel amazing. The material is the quality of LuluLemons, which I have a large collection of their products. I was so surprised to find these joggers are just as high quality for way less price."
3040,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Wear Everyday...Seriously I received one of these as a gift, and had to go back and order more. I LOVE this hoodie. It is very comfortable, keeps me just warm enough, and washes very easily. The fit is loose, but not overly baggy. The sleeves are a good length, and fit my wrists well. The price is reasonable. I have noticed that after wearing my original product every day for two months, it has started to pill just slightly on the sleeves. I seriously wore it everyday for several hours at least, so I think it is still high quality :) I typically wash on cold and hang dry, I have not noticed any shrinkage."
3041,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Beautiful product Love the comfort fit. great stretch

3044,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great for price 5‚Äô9 185, muscular build. These fit great and will not shrink in dryer. Nips wont be slipping out and they are very comfy. Tight on lats but fit well."
3045,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Dress fit great. The breast area is a little weird fitting ... Based on reviews I ordered a small. I am typically a medium or large. I'm 4'11 and 146lbs. Dress fit great. The breast area is a little weird fitting but I love how the dress flows and it's super comfortable. Straps are adjustable. Added a cute silver belt.
3046,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Replacing old worn out sweatshirt I purchased this to replace my 8 year old, worn out identical gray sweatshirt.  It was exactly the same good quality and fit as my old Russell Atheletic sweatshirt."

3051,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Order 1-2 sizes down for compression I ordered these to wear as under shirts when I wear an open sweater or hoodie or something. I usually wear an xl-xxl in tops so I ordered xxl in these. They are definitely NOT compression if you order your normal size, but they are slim fitting and flattering at the waist. If you want compression I'd recommend to order 1-2 sizes down."
3052,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great for underneath I bought it in a size large. Im 5'6 32ddd bust 24in waist. I bought them to wear under my scrubs which is perfect, i wouldnt wear them just out and about because they are not the most flattering but underneath to layer is perfect. Also i could fit in a size medium for more of a compression style. The only thing is the sleeves are a little to short so i have to wear them rolled up."
3053,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"So comfortable! Very nice! I bought these after I saw someone else wearing them. Love that they are not tight in legs like leggings are. These are so comfy, love the pockets! Super soft and wash & wear well! I liked them so much, I bought multiple pairs including the capris ‚ô•Ô∏è"
3054,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Great, good quality."
3055,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Adorable, very eye catching, quality in this was just ok Really really cute but the border at the bottom didn‚Äôt line up correctly. It was a little off. Material is a little strange, it looks a little faded black in areas. I may try to lighter color dress with more beige: brown / green pattern. Because it is a great price for a cute summery dress"
3056,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Lightweight. Wish the arm holes were a bit larger.  Everything else is fine.

3062,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,BUY THIS! I bought one....then 4 more. This shirt elongates your body and makes you look thin! At first I ordered a medium and then sized down for a small. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù 143lbs for reference. Both fit well but I like the smalls better. Perfect for working out or wearing casually with jeans and a bandeau.

3080,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I absolutely love this dress!! I absolutely love this dress! Super comfy, love that it has pockets. I'm very small, 5'4"" and 90 lbs. I always have trouble finding clothes that fit me properly, but this dress comes pretty close. IMO, it runs a little big in the chest area but keep in mind, I'm very tiny. I have received a handful of compliments when wearing this dress"
3081,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Love these, going to order more! I love these tanks! I get hot and sweaty at work and bought these to wear under my shirts to help wick sweat away, and they work great!  They keep me cool and dry while at work.  I will be ordering more!  They are form fitting, and I thought the sizing was pretty accurate.  I ordered large, and would normally wear a large in form fitting wear.  I recommend!!  Get these, you won't be disappointed!"
3082,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,I'm ordering more!! The fit and feel of these are great!!
3083,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Yeah thee ha thr Blah haha üòÑ
3084,5,B09M6X79V9,1,great tank!! Im 5'7&#34; 145LB DD..... Medium fits perfect.....they wash real well too.
3085,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,High Quality Sweatshirt Good sweatshirt..washes well.very warm..much better than Champion.I'll probably get a few more in different colors.Another reason I like it so much is that it's a 4 season product.
3086,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Can't go wrong, but some! Best workout tanks, love them. Wish there were more colors because they are so comfortable I'd wear them everyday."
3087,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Really nice I work in healthcare and it‚Äôs always so cold .. these are great alternatives to under scrubs. I also workout straight after work so it‚Äôs convenient and dual purpose! Love how they fit the body and are great quality
3088,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Great products! Great shirt. Definitely ordering more!
3089,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Pleased... I was in need of additional exercise tops. The product was cost effective and they fit perfectly.  I would purchase again.
3090,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"All sweats/fleece should be made with this material weight I have been looking for substantial sweats/fleece, but keep find light weight, flimsy ones that would not keep a bear warm and that don't last very long.  I certainly could not find anything even approaching what I wanted in women's clothing.  I began looking in men's clothing and found more of the same in mind numbing search ...<br /><br />I found this shirt.  It is a nice sturdy medium weight with well constructed seams.  It washes without noticeable bleeding, fading, or piling.  That it came in purple was a plus as I could wear it to my grandsons sporting events.<br /><br />The reason for 4 rather 5 stars is that it is pricey."
3091,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Nice look This product is amazing. It looks good in the outside
3092,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Five Stars Great value, fits as expected!"
3093,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Amazing tanks! Fits great, looks great if you're fit! Lightweight and cool."
3094,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Same quality as Nike compression tanks Great quality. Almost exact quality of Nike $30 compression tanks. Runs a bit large. Suggest a size smaller.
3095,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Love these!! I want to wear these everyday, everywhere!"
3096,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Quality Great fit and quality shirt. I'm taller so usually have trouble with extra large shirts being too short
3097,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Five Stars Love it, my favorite."
3098,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I only buy Russell anyway, but... Great sweat shirt, but the V under the chin is slightly off center.  For me it's no sweat as it's for really casual wear."
3099,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Durable and affordable! Orderd these the same day as the Long sleeve compression shirts to use in the gym . They are true to size and comfortable.
3100,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Bang for your buck Can‚Äôt go wrong for the price . Quality enough for the gym

3112,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Warm, comfy Keeps me very warm in cold temperatures. I wear a soft shell jacket over it and I'm good to go, in freezing temperatures I wear an extra hoodie. It's comfortable and durable."
3113,5,B0B16Q1854,1,runs larger awsome
3114,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great product for price The cut is awesome, the material is really light weight which is a positive and negative: I wish it was a little higher quality, but the thinness of it makes it nice for when you get hot working out."

3116,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great shirts Husband loves them
3117,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,great item! nice sweatshirt  -  good quality fabric - good construction - good fit
3118,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great for heavy sweat producers. It‚Äôs a different style than I‚Äôm used to, but I love these shirts for spin class. I sweat a lot (I produce a lake under my bike) and these shirts never feel like they get stuck to me and I never feel like I‚Äôm going to overheat.  They‚Äôve been through the wash at least a dozen times each without any noticeable change. This is my second set of these. After the first set, I bought a second set because I like them so much and they are my go-to shirt for spin class now. Love that they come in 3-packs."
3119,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great product Great shirts.  Based on reviews that they run a little big, I ordered a medium (usually large) and it fit perfectly.  I would have loved these to be a little longer but honestly I love them."
3120,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Amazing
3121,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"I still get camel toe with these I like the way that these fit however, I still do get a bit of a camel toe if I have my feet together. They are very comfortable and didn‚Äôt slide down at all during my workout."
3122,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,The stress is really comfortable and I love the pockets I'm kind of short ... The stress is really comfortable and I love the pockets I'm kind of short but it still doesn't touch the ground
3123,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Best Dang Hoodie Ever Made To keep you warm, Jerzees hoodies have thicker and better constructed material than Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, and other comparable brands. They hold up great to work, hunting, exercise, school, and many many wash cycles. Jerzees is hands down the best hoodie made in my opinion."
3124,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Best workout pants! Love the material. I‚Äôve purchased 2 pairs because they are perfect gym tights. Not see through, sweat resistant (purchased in dark gray & blk, not sure how other colors will be against sweat) great stretch and holds everything in. I feel confident wearing them, will be buying kore colors."
3125,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"DON‚ÄôT THINK IT TWICE I loved these pants so much. I got a pink and a navy blue, now looking to buy a couple more. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and weight 107lbs (pant size is usually US 2-4) got both in Small and they fit just as expected. The fabric is perfect for exercising, and being comfy. I‚Äôm even thinking about using these as scrub pants for work. Great product! Sometimes they have flash deals on these so even better! üôå"
3126,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Stretch The item was transcendent. Packaging was invaluable. Delivery was very fast. A++!
3127,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Soft I got a size up (L) because I enjoy having on comfortable, larger sweaters. It fits great, and I ended up getting two in different colors!"
3128,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Great material and feel. Not restrictive but holds well. I've ordered more.
3129,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,It feels comfortable and attractive. Extremely well made hooded zip-up. It feels comfortable and attractive. I started wearing it right out of the box and I love it. Great price too! Very pleased.
3130,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Sizing is nuts. I used to be really big, then I lost a lot of weight, and now I wear a size medium normally. However, I'm very self-conscious of my arms (flabby, loose skin, etc) so I wanted to get some long-sleeved shirts to layer under T-shirts and stuff, to essentially hide my arms and still let me show off my collection of pop culture T-shirts. For this purpose, these will work, so I give the product four stars.<br /><br />However. I ordered a size large, and when I got my shirts, the tags on them said ""XL."" So right off the bat, they didn't send me what I ordered. Maybe I should be glad, though, because these shirts run SO SMALL that a size large fits on me the way a small would. Like I said, I'm normally a medium, but if I'd ordered my true size, it would not have fit AT ALL, and I'd have looked and felt like a stuffed sausage. Just a fair warning to others, you might want to size up two-to-three sizes!<br /><br />So I took a star off for the completely skewed sizing (unless I somehow received a different product than everyone else in these reviews). And also, while it ended up helping me THIS TIME with this particular product, they completely sent me the wrong size."
3131,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"greatquality material no shrinking after wash looked around for a cheap set of these and am very happy with the product.  they are inexpensive, but do not feel/ look cheap at all, 100% recommend - im 6'0 180 perfect for gym, or whatever else!"
3132,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nothing Love it

3139,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Great play dress Nice, stretchy fabric. Very comfortable."
3140,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good Hoodie I was not expecting much from a 20-dollar hoodie but it's very comfortable and fits just right.
3141,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Price and comfort I love the softness of the material. I wear these for all occasions. My only complaint is that they could be just a little longer because I‚Äôm tall.

3149,4,B076QD9NP1,1,Four Stars The dress was what i expected. Fit too. Came in a timely manner
3150,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Too large to wear on it's own (as a medium ... Too large to wear on it's own (as a medium, what!) but will probably be OK as the last outer layer this year in the snow."
3151,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fit My husband likes the variety of colors
3152,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Cute and simple dress for dog themed party! I bought this dress for my daughter's dog themed birthday party. She loved it. Its light and fresh. She is seven and tall so this size fit her just right.
3153,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Same great fit and quality! Same as they've ever been. Love these sweatshirts. I've been wearing them for thirty years.
3154,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Runs Small I absolutely love these shirts.  My friend ordered a set and warned me that they run small.  I'm 5""4"", 133lbs. and usually wear a M.  I ordered this in a XL and it's perfect.  I like the length - low on the hips, the scoop neckline and the stretchy fabric.  Lots of colors to choose from and you can't beat the price for 3.  I'll be ordering more."
3155,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Unique workout clothes I love these for the gym or running
3156,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Perfect fit I love these legging they‚Äôre super comfy. I highly recommend
3157,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Just as shown Its just so beautiful
3158,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sturdy comfort Comfortably
3159,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,cute leggings/fit well These fit great. Out of package they look like childs tights. I tried them on and they fit great! They are a little thin so im not sure yet if they are squat proof.
3160,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"I like the fit of this Dude, I am loving this! Suns out - guns out! ha, just kidding (kinda). I like the fit of this. It wears and hangs well. I have washed and dried it with no problems. I should have bought the 3 pack instead. Def. would recommend."
3161,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Happy with my order My husband likes it
3162,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Four Stars Overall excellent!! Great for working out
3163,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Workout ready Beautiful and I love the material
3164,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Boyfriend LOVES This My boyfriend had a Nike hoodie that shrunk every time we washed it and dried it.  We had to air dry it which was way too much trouble.  I studied all the hoodies and gave this as a gift.  He totally loves it,  keeps showing me how warm it is and how well made it is.  I finally got a winner by reading reviews!  It's warm, thick and made well.  True to size.  He wears an XL and it was perfect.  The Nike ran small."
3165,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Wowza! The color does not fade. I‚Äôve warn this dozens of times and it‚Äôs still as vibrant and cheerful as ever! Super soft. Super comfy. Would definitely purchase again!!
3166,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice Quality Size was true, quality was good....Great product."
3167,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"NO BREST SUPPORT. Even though their is no breast support, they look great under some too low cut tops that I have. with built in bras."
3168,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"LOVE THESE leggings!!!&lt;3 [[VIDEOID:1b8c4d21c690a6bd00ab891de9b03fc9]] I‚Äôve bought I believe 4 of these already because I love them so much!<br />Super comfy and the colors I have bought do seem to be squat proof. But if u want to be safe just wear same color or nude undies. Incase it‚Äôs helpful although we all Carry our weight differently, I am 5‚Äô4‚Äô‚Äô about 167lbs I have a mommy belly flab which these leggings help with.<br /><br />I‚Äôve gotten size Large but my last pair was a Medium that fit more snug which I don‚Äôt mind.<br /><br />I want to try out the shorts next!!!!<br /><br />Don‚Äôt hesitate try these and you won‚Äôt regret it."
3169,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,This is shipping from overseas so not a quick delivery. Really liked the gray/teal.. It's a heavy enough weight to actually be a light jacket as opposed to just a fashionable piece. My Ship time was insane ( almost 50 days from order). But I have worn pretty much daily for last 30 days ( it really works with everything!). Washes well. Runs Very small (recommend to upsize  2-3 sizes) and shorted them pictured but still long enough.
3170,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Warm soft and it covers my torso completely. I'm 6'3 most XXLs are too short to cover my torso amply. Russell never fails. I dont like to wear logos it makes me feel like a living billboard due to my size and the little white tag was easy to remove with some precision string cutting. Would buy it again.
3171,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Five Stars good quality tank
3172,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,You‚Äôre go to under shirt! I wear them everyday!
3173,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"i need this in every color it‚Äôs got this great fit to my body, it isnt baggy at all. some of these styles can make you look like you have a belly, it doesnt! it shows off my booty, too. the material is thin. fits to size. i need multiple of these."
3174,5,B009R09Z8W,1,As Pictured and Nice Quality Purchased for my granddaughter and she seemed to like it very much!
3175,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Cute but to small Should buy this item a size up then what you wear. Nice material.
3176,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,The best brand for men‚Äôs racerback tanks. I‚Äôve only wear tank tops to the gym.  I‚Äôve always been in the search of the perfect tank top.  I have been wanting to try a racerback cut to see how it felt while lifting but was thought it might feel weird for showing too much of the back.  I was wrong about it feeling weird. This racerback tank feels great and very natural and I now cannot image lifting wearing any other type of shirt.  The racer back cut is just enough to give you a better range or motion and helps you keep cool.  Neleus has mastered the men‚Äôs racerback tank top.  This tank has more coverage then a typical stringer and you don‚Äôt have to worry about your nipples popping out or showing too much of your upper body.  Just the perfect balance of coverage and skin for the gym or can even pull off for just a great casual tank for summer days.
3177,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Love it Great dress! Love the way it fits.
3178,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Great value I really like this dress. It‚Äôs a great option for a dinner date mid week that you just want to look dressed up and feel comfortable.<br />The only thing I would change is the tie on the shoulder. It just doesn‚Äôt lay right and you can‚Äôt put it to the back of your neck!
3179,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Buy these! Just got these and I love them.  Can‚Äôt wait to wear them to workout.
3180,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"LOVE IT!! This dress is so comfortable, light and cute!!! I love the pockets and the flow. Perfect purchase!"
3181,4,B0928FSGGD,1,NELEUS Women's 3 Pack Compression Shirts Long Sleeve Yoga Athletic Shirts Great as expected and led to believe. I will buy more!
3182,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Very comfy, Color is a little lighter than the picture shows. Great fit, comfy, stays in place. The color is more of a periwinkle than ink blue."
3183,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Just get them! If you‚Äôre thinking about getting them, do it.  For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1, 115-120lb, 32D, petite-muscular-idk-I‚Äôm active?, and got the XS. If you want more of a looser fit, maybe go a size up because this fits like a glove. I‚Äôm glad I went with the XS because my waist is short and these are a great length and fit.  They‚Äôre not ‚Äúcompressive,‚Äù but they‚Äôre very, very comfortable. I have tons of lululemon ss/ls swiftly (4-for snug fits, 6-for a bit of breathing room), but I just can‚Äôt justify spending $60 on a swiftly tank or power y, when there are other options - like this!! They have a little bit of shine to them, but not much at all, and I‚Äôve included pics with flash to compare them with some of the lulu, as well as the black on black with Nike shorts, so I think the fabric is great! I would definitely wear these casually, and technically for workouts and yoga. These don‚Äôt have shelf bras, and while shelf bras are great for low impact (yoga, lifting, etc), I don‚Äôt ever feel like shelf bras are enough for HITs (running, jumping, etc), so these are perfect.  I haven‚Äôt washed them, but it feels like I could wash them with my other workout clothes and dry them on medium. It‚Äôs polyester and spandex so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll shrink, and if it does I‚Äôll update the post. Hope that helps!"
3184,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,What I needed. Like the lightness of the material.
3185,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"THEY ARE GREAT!!! Highly recommend. I am a leggings Guru/ connoisseur... i have leggings from Cute Booty Lounge, CLS, NVGTN, Gym Shark, and lots other brands. & i can say these leggins are GREAT, they are extremely soft, good compression, but not too much to where your chub(if any) squeezes out, not see through, very flexible-<br />I ordered the grey contour pair, size LARGE. I am 5'7 158# on a bad day."
3186,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfect Size, Exactly as described Great shirts that were true to my size. I went with what i normally get and it worked out fine. The shirts are breathable mesh and feel great- Will def buy another pack!"
3187,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I live in these things... Just what I expected -- of course, I've bought them and loved them before, so I knew what to expect. Basically, I live in these things :-)"
3188,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,A little long The fit is as expected but the seller should consider a 7/8 length because they were pretty long on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and about 140lbs and ordered a medium and they‚Äôre about two inches too long. (Unless they have that length and I just couldn‚Äôt find it).
3189,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars 5' 2&#34; 42D. Fit great
3190,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Keeping my husband warm on these cold winter nights in the mountains.
3191,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Get a smaller size I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0. 210.. got XL.. fits ok on top.. too baggy and long .. needs to be tapered for more athletic fit.

3199,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars They are great for when I work out. They keep me dry and are so comfortable.
3200,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Buy 1 or 2 sizes up I'm 5'10"" and 160lbs and normally wear a M, but I bought this in an XL and it fits GREAT! The sleeves are long enough for me and it should be great for working out or riding my bike when it is cooler. Also, the fabric is nice quality. For the price, I'd say it is a great deal."
3201,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice Nice I like it
3202,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Underscrubs I love these shirts! I was looking for some underscrubs for my job and I did not want cotton as I didn‚Äôt want to get too hot. These are the perfect in between for me as they aren‚Äôt too thick or too thin. Very comfortable material.
3203,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Five Stars Love, love. Love it. Fits perfect! No one wears poka dots anymore. Makes you feel like a lady"
3204,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Soft and comfortable Shipping was absolutely terrible. I don't appreciate my package being full on thrown on to my porch. So disrespectful. 8 really wished Amazon would just use there people to deliver vs the postal services. Item it self is perfect and exactly what I wanted for son. Price was a steal. Definitely would buy again.
3205,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Nice top Nice top - I like the high neckline.  Fits as expected.
3206,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good price, will order one more Well made and great for casual wear"
3207,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Versatile and easy to care for Cute and easy to wear. Love the extra long sleeves! Fabric is a little thinner than I had hoped, (not great for warmth) but ok. Great piece for layering!"
3208,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Recommend ordering a size larger than standard US sizing. Very nice product at an extremely reasonable price. I normally wear a XL, and these don‚Äôt have any real give or stretch. Following recommendations, I ordered a 2XL and it fit perfectly: snug but not uncomfortable or restrictive. They seem well made, and are exactly what I was looking for."

3210,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"A little short I like these tops, other than the fact that they are a little short in the torso."
3211,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great leggings I love how they fit, I ordered a small I‚Äôm about 135 lbs and I‚Äôm 5,6."
3212,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Best sweatshirt for your money Really comfortable and well made. I've bought these before. Shouldn't fade or shrink if dry on low heat. Can spend a lot more for bigger name brand but it won't be better quality.
3213,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sweatshirt My dad loves this brand of sweatshirts. He just threw one away after 4 years of wearing it. Good quality
3214,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice ..warm and soft .. Nice ..warm and soft.  washes well
3215,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Comfy and Looks great! Awesome product, very affordable, looks and feels great. FYI... I would get a size up possibly.. I hover between a medium and large, had to go large for sure."

3217,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars It help me warm in this cold winter.
3218,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Great for price Great for price...super comfy....too bif though.. ordered a small ended up selling them to a friend who is medium and they fit her perfect!!
3219,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great deal on Sweatshirt What a great shirt; exactly what I ordered for a special person.
3220,5,B009R09Z8W,1,One word: Perfect!
3221,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I'd give it 5 stars but.... Don't get me wrong this hoodie is high quality for the $, medium weight yet very warm, has the perfect size front pocket and the ties for the hood have nice big knots so you're not loosing your mind when one side of the string disappears into the tunnel of no return.<br /><br />Here is the only problem....I just look too damn good in this thing!!  Maybe I should not have bought the royal blue color because it brings out the color of my eyes too much or something?!??!  I bought this sweatshirt to get stuff done in it.  Workout, rake the leaves, toss the ball around in the backyard, but every time I put it on my wife attacks me like some wild animal!!  I try to run but she very quick and grabs the hood to clothes-lining me to the floor and then she pounce and it is all over, my afternoon plans are ruined.<br /><br />The sweatshirt has held up very well through all the rough activity so I suppose that does speak to the quality of material and stitching.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm being unfair to Russell Athletic by penalizing the product for something completely out of their control?"
3222,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good quality I ordered two of these hoodies. They both fit well and are of good quality. Fabric is not thin or cheap. Colors are accurate as shown. Hoodies are comfortably roomy (enough to not hug the belly) but not oversized. Sleeves are long, which is how I like them, but they are not too long. Pocket is sewn well. Cuffs are tight enough that it takes effort to push them up to elbow, so I expect they won't easily become stretched out & loose. Hood is good size- stays up without being too deep. I have zero complaints and would order more.<br />Very happy with them."
3223,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable Tanjs Live the tanks, they fit very comfortably. True to size."

3230,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Favorite pants ever!! I am 5' 3"" 130lbs and ordered a Medium‚Äîthey fit perfectly, and are so comfy! I love the higher waistband, well-made fabric/feel, and think the length is just right. After liking my first pair so much, I went and bought a second pair in another color. :)"
3231,5,B09M6X79V9,1,I got my regular size and it fits me perfect. I work out a lot and wanted a comfy workout shirt that wasn‚Äôt huge. I‚Äôm sort and often they are so long on me. I ordered my usual size and they fit perfect.  I will order more in different colors !!
3232,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Best joggers These joggers are the best. I usually wear a medium and I like the way they fit but I sized up in another color to get it fitting a little looser. I love both sizes and all the colors. Will be buying more.

3243,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,My favorite go to gym tank! Highly recommend! I know these are men‚Äôs tanks but I love the fit and material of them. So comfortable and breathable for lounging in or working out in. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô2‚Äù roughly 160lbs  my bust is about 32 and I got a medium snd they fit exactly how I expected. Just loose enough to be comfortable but not baggy. I need to get ALL the colors.
3244,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Soft material great fit Soft fabric and great dress for travel and no wrinkles.  Many compliments every time I wear this out to dinner at the coast.  Size is true to measure. Takes a bit longer to arrive and worth the wait.
3245,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Good Like
3246,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Beautiful!! This is my new favorite dress! Just ordered more in different colors.
3247,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"the 3 shirts compress to different degrees; overall, great value and does the job I'm glad that these shirts actually stand up to the ""compression"" term in their product name.  however, degree of compression DOES differ since it would appear fabric construction differs!  sizing appears to be consistent so maybe it's the fabric composition?<br /><br />- white shirt: most compression.  thickest material feel<br />- grey shirt: medium compression.  thinnest material feel<br />- black shirt: medium compression.  feels slightly thicker than the grey shirt.<br /><br />the shirts have contrast double stitching with asymmetrical seam lines...for what purpose, i'm not sure, maybe it's supposed to help with silhouette aesthetics?  I could have done without the contrast coloring and asymmetrical stitching since my plan is to wear these tops UNDER short sleeve day dresses/shirts/tops, so wanted something that ""matches"" more easily.  but oh well.  works well enough.<br /><br />feels pretty comfy too."
3248,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,If you like sweatshirts ... this is it! If you like sweatshirts ... this is it!
3249,5,B0928FSGGD,1,It is from China so be prepared. It does seem like everything from China is a bit smaller.<br />These are in the same category. I normally wear a large\XL so I purchased the XL\XXL.<br />They are really a great price for a 3 shirt package. I love the long sleeves. The material is very breathable and light. They offer an array of colors as well.
3250,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Love it!! Got compliments the first day! I‚Äôm a big guy but this makes me feel comfortable while working out. I‚Äôm about 290lbs and not all muscle lol you‚Äôll love this shirt and it‚Äôs true on size

3253,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great price Too long.
3254,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Perfect. I am obsessed with these pants. They're the perfect length for me. I'm 4'11 and they hit at the ankle. I am curvy and usually wear a  large or XL. I bought an XL because I wanted to make sure they would be a looser fit. They fit like a dream. The color was true to the picture. The pants are so soft and comfy. They don't make a lot of noise when you move. Love them!
3255,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Flattering Flattering, sexy but not too sexy, comfortable, quality."
3256,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Great Hoodie for the price and good quality I very much like this hoodie. For the price you can't go wrong.  I think I'll order a second one.
3257,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Very comfortable shirt for workout or hangout These showed up at the house and were an immediate hit.  Right out of the box the material is light and feels comfortable. I was showing my wife and she took 1 of them for herself to wear around the house.  She does look better than I do in it, but I ended up ordering another pack so I could have some for the gym.  Great Product!  Best bang for your buck."

3263,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"great leggings, amazing customer service I ordered a pair of these last week and they were AMAZING. So amazing I ordered another pair a few days later. I just got those in and they fit completely different and the material felt different. I was very disappointed. Especially because I had recommended them to a lot of people and it seems they are inconsistent.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW: after I wrote this review I was contacted directly by the seller apologizing for the inconsistency. She had told me that the second pair I got was in fact a different material that the first pair. She offered to send me a free pair of leggings that were the material of my first pair. I was shocked with the customer service I received. she was very prompt to replying and definitely wanted me to be satisfied. I am very happy!"
3264,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great Product! Great Fit! What I anticipated! Happy that I purchased Six!!!

3266,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Instantly my Second Fav Workout slim Tank I'm 5'9"" at 161lbs athletic build and wear a 41 jacket qnd 31"" waist. These tanks are awesome. They are a fit between slim and compression. On me you can see (darker tank) it is slim on my frame. I'm comparing it to my Nike tank that is my favorite and silkier in feel than these and also a bit longer. But you can't beat the price, fit, and look of these at all. I was totally and pleasantly surprised. I wear a size medium and got mediums and they fit very well. A must buy if you don't want baggy athletic wear that most vendors well here."
3267,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Pretty tight This is comfortable and good for home work outs but is not at all flattering so I rarely wear it out of the house. Runs small
3268,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Perfect for gym Thin material which I like for the gym. Love the cut. Flattering and still has the Tom boy look. I usually wear a small but downsized to an xsmall because I wanted A more fitted look. Will order again

3271,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Similar to Old Navy swing dress I was looking for a dress like the Old Navy swing dress and this is it. Order one size larger than Old Navy. The fabric is a bit thinner in comparison but otherwise very similar. Flattering for those who have a belly to hide.
3272,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Save the money and buy these! These are pretty much an exact dupe for gym shark! Worth the purchase they fit amazing and are super cute! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 170 / waist 28in / hips 42in / thighs 24in / purchased a medium.
3273,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great for wearing under something else! I bought these to go thrifting without needing a dressing room.Covers my butt and does not creep up at all!I bought a 3x to make sure it did cover.Great product!

3285,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits like a medium would but don't go by the sizing Fits like a medium would but don't go by the sizing. I'm normally an xs-s but due to &#34;fitted&#34; and the size charts I went up a size. Don't do it. Going to reorder in a small. The mediums work fine because I can tie them up and they are cute still

3287,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars My daughter absolutely loves it!
3288,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Finally a maxi I can wear! I am 5‚Äô2 at most and maxi dresses never work for me. Petite cuts with pockets are a total unicorn, but here it is! I had to tighten the straps a bit (not busty) and that helped make it work height wise as well. I wore it and it was so comfortable and flowy and caught the breeze nicely. I want bra-less and it was loose enough that I felt well covered.<br /><br />For reference i am not skinny, and have a bit of hips and tummy, and the small was perfect. I recommend sizing down a little (I wear a medium in most pieces)."
3289,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Perfect dress! This length is perfect! Love this soft dress! Depending on how you accessorize, it can be either casual or dressy."
3290,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Loose, Not billowing or so long Well. The fabric is soft and flowy rayon that feels perfect against my skin. The dress is comfortable. It is Not maxi long. I'll post a pic which I've never done but more and more I mistrust descriptions and very much rely on reviews. I am 5'9&#34; size 12. Also there's a seam in the front instead of the back which makes me uncomfortable because I keep thinking I'm wearing it backwards (but the tag is at my back)."
3291,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Comfortable and Breathable I bought these looking for something different than what I normally wear and they fit great and are very breathable as well.
3292,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars keeps me warm ...  ;)
3293,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Perfect for exercising These tops fit well and are comfortable. I'm 5'3.5 (gotta count that half inch!) 114lbs and a Small fit just fine. They are not as long as other workout tops, so if you want something longer, these might not be what you're looking for."

3305,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"It's Russell - What else but perfect could it be? Russell makes the best sweatshirts, long sleeve heavyweight t-shirts and short sleeve shirts. The shipment arrived when it was supposed to; fit is perfect. Can't go wrong with Russell and this sweatshirt."
3306,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Good for work in the sun Nice shirt to work in the sun

3309,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,I think he likes it fine. This was part of my grandson's Christmas gift.  I think he likes it fine.
3310,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"You'll want to live in this dress in the heat This dress is wonderful! The V neck in the front isn't super low, so going sans a bra (if you prefer) is comfortable and covered. The dress material is  very cool against your skin. In that heat we've had here lately that was very very welcome! I'm 5'5 and ordered and XL and the length is perfect. It hits right above my ankle so if I wear flip flops or sandals I'm not stepping on the front of the dress. It is cut slightly shorter in the front than in the back and I think they did that on purpose. The dress is roomy front to back and side to side. I typically order a size larger than what I think I would fit b/c I don't like the tight feeling around my chest. This dress is a perfect fit all around. It has pockets!!!! They aren't very deep, but very comfortable for a hand rest. I haven't tested out if a key or other items wold stay in there but I think small items would. The only reason I gave this dress 4 stars instead of 5 is because the seam in the front is very strange. In the stock photos you can see on some of the dresses but not others. There is a seam right up the front. Not a deal breaker but it's just very strange there would be a seam in the front and not the back? This makes the dots not line up at all. Probably just being overly picky but if you have a seam, why not put it in the back? I get there are seams on the sides, and there are pockets, but the back piece is solid and the front is the one that's cut with a seam. I don't understand. Again, not a deal breaker just something I noticed and thought very easily could have been switched to the other side. All in all you will love this dress. It's perfect for being outside in the garden, running to the store, or throwing on some jewelry and going out to a restaurant or gathering."
3311,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Excellent Product As Advertised
3312,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good for layering I use this at work. I work in a cooler most of the day and these are perfect for layering. I also use them for walking. They are perfect for both things.

3346,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfy as... Only have it four stars because it‚Äôs bigger then expected. But hey, buying clothes online normally works out this way. Every brand makes their sizes different. I got a large because I own a large pullover hoodie which fits perfectly for a hoodie. This however is a tad too big. And what I mean is that the sleeves are like little wings lol. Other then that I love it. Sleeves are the right length just a bit flappy."
3347,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Greatest undershirts ever These shirts are great. I've actually stopped wearing my regular ones. I'm gonna order more to make sure I have enough for an entire month and just get rid of all my old ones.

After watching a million YouTube reviews In look for high wasted seamless leggings, I decided to give these leggings a try... and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I want these in every color! My color is 100% squat proof, but the company does tell you in the pictures that some colors are not totally squat proof, so if make sure you look for that.<br /><br />These leggings also fit me perfectly length-wise. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and leggings are usually so long on me, but these are the perfect length. Cannot recommend enough!"

3364,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Sweater is good for sports Sweater is good for sports: soft, thin but dense, comfortable on top of thermal underwear.<br /><br />But I have to agree with other reviewers: sizing is wrong<br />I normally wear L, so I picked that size. It turned out to be too large. I understand that this is a loose fit, but take a look at my neck and shoulders.<br /><br />I'm waiting for M and will update my review after I will receive it."

My husband is fussy about his clothes comfort is 100% most important.  Not having logos and printing as a primary feature is a must.  Russell is very classy with this shirt... only a small tag shows their brand.  He is so happy and so am I. These look great over a collared shirt!"

3485,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Rating product On the torso the item is slightly loose. I ordered a small. Fits nice in all other areas. I made need to gain muscle but the item is good.
3486,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars You can never go wrong with Russell.
3487,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice But ... Daughter loved it.  She sewed a logo on the back.  The sleeve came apart at the seam and needed to be restitched.
3488,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Perfect! Great fit and lightweight
3489,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Size down and they're great I am not sure why people are saying these are too small, they absolutely run large. I need tight tanks for hot yoga and I am picky about fit- it's not easy to find affordable tanks that check all the boxes for me, and these are great. They do not ride up, and are plenty long enough for those of us with long torsos, and the price is right. I am usually a medium and got the small, so they fit perfect for my needs. As for flattering, They are tight. But comfortable! Buy cotton or something else if you're concerned with how they look- these are for working out."

(I might have to get another one so I‚Äôll always feel this great)
3494,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great hoodie I've bought a couple sweatshirts lately from the local mega discount store and have been pretty unhappy with the thickness and durability. This one is much thicker and seems to be much more durable. It fits well, is soft and warm. My only complaint would be the lint that it leaves behind on my shirt after I take it off. I haven't washed it yet. Hopefully a good inside-out wash will eliminate that pesky lint."
3495,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Best sweathshirt ever! I wear sweatshirts a lot and work outside in cold weather. These are the warmest shirts I have ever worn. I have worn Russell sweatshirts for a while and used to purchase them locally but the store no longer carries them. The shirts are full cut so you have plenty of room and don't bind while you are lifting or moving things. This is not a close fitting crop top type of shirt but made for full mobility, warmth and longevity."

3502,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great comfortable shirt! Love these shirts! After hopeless searching, purchasing, and returning on Amazon for a perfect tank, y-back, stringer, gym shirt; I got the 3 pack in a large (my usual USA size) and they fit just right. Hopefully, after another 3 months in the gym, I‚Äôll be ordering the next size up in some new colors.<br /><br />That said, I hope they have good customer service because the sewing is off on one of the shoulder seams and I‚Äôd really like a replacement that is sewn properly."
3503,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Perfect for below average height guys I like that there is an extra small size for guys like me other products should have that kind of availability.

3510,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Five Stars I Loved Them! Perfect !
3511,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Big I usually get shirts in mediums. So, I bought this in medium. But, it was way too big for me. I like the color and quality so I'm returning it and getting it in small."
3512,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars It' a comfortable, good looking sweatshirt that is also durable."
3513,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice I bought this for my coworker for purple day at work she seems to like it
3514,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Love! Love! These tops are wonderful for working out in. You don‚Äôt feel the sweat and their comfortable
3515,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Pretty nice, def Pretty nice, def. shows every lump and bump though, and I wish I got a larger size. I got Medium based on other reviews- I am 5'6&#34;, 160 lbs and 38&#34; D bust. Should have gone large. Product is as shown though, bright colors, fabric is nice."
3516,5,B09M6X79V9,1,how good it feels I looks good on me and I love is.
3517,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Really good quality. It looks better than the picture Really good quality.  It looks better than the picture.
3518,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"I absolutely LOVE these compression tanks I absolutely LOVE these compression tanks!  They are perfect as well as perfect to size!  I ordered a Medium but when I opened the bag they looked small to me.  But once I put one on it was perfect!  I'm going to purchase more of these in the variety of colors they come in.  Also, they are perfect for kickboxing class or any class for that matter!  Highly recommend!!!"
3519,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,That it‚Äôs a great fit & the inside is nice and soft. It was a Christmas gift & it was a nice fit.
3520,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars I LOVE THEM
3521,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Five Stars Like the material. I got the orange one and it‚Äôs a bit see through.
3522,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Pretty good These were extremely comfortable and very good at sweat wiking! My only problem is they kept rising up and would not stay in place
3523,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good value, slightly snug fit. I‚Äôm a big guy so I know how I like an XXL to fit.  As an XXL, these are a great, slightly snug, workout shirt.  I myself was hoping for something bigger/looser and probably could have ordered a XXXL.  All in all a good buy at a fair price."
3524,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"fit tanks I had to get use to this shirt at first, I love them, I plan to order more.  good support. doesn't loose shape when washed"
3525,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Amazing and perfectly fitted Simple to wear and quality seems great. I just bought it so I have to put it to test
3526,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Sweatshrit Fit true to size. Seem like better quality than some discount Box Store brands.
3527,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great workout top I ordered three of these tops and will probably be ordering more. They're flattering without being super tight or fitted. I know a lot of reviews said to size down, but I went with my normal medium and it fit perfectly. I also read somewhere that you shouldn't put them in the dryer after washing, so I've been air drying and they still look great and have maintained their shape."
3528,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Pretty Decent for Price This hoodie is great, good quality for the price (as far as first time wear as far as I‚Äôm aware) and very comfortable. The hood is a bit big for my liking but overall great hoodie :)"
3529,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Polka dot dress Love the way it flows.  Perfect for hot weather.
3530,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,excellent value Very happy with the quality and price of this product. Actually blown away! Ordered my normal XL size and it fit perfectly snug without feeling compressed. Fabric has a nice smooth 'feel' to it. I almost never write reviews but I am so pleased with this product that I made an exception. It's particularly well suited to anyone that has some chest muscles they don't mind showing off.
3531,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good Buy Bought for husband for extra layer in house during winter... fits great ..washes well.. he loves it!
3532,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Good quality. Good price
3533,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Ummmm buy these NOW! Holy cow!! I have the actual lululemon joggers and I like these ones way more. These are a little thicker than my lulu ones so I don‚Äôt feel like they will pill or fall apart as easily. You cannot beat the price or their color selection. If you want joggers because they give you a little more breathing room than leggings then get these!! Just do it. NOW!
3534,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,GREAT SLEEVELESS MUSCLE TANKS They fit as expected and love the colors and the design.
3535,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Very pretty So unique my daughter wore to her dog themed birthday party!
3536,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Big & plushy Very soft, plush, and comfy. A bit large at first...we'll see how much shrinkage after washing ;)"
3537,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"but I like it that way it was longer than the usual hoodies, but I like it that way.  Fit exactly the way I like it ."
3538,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love them! Buy them! I got the regular black ones and they‚Äôre perfect! They fit true to size but I went a size up because I like a looser fit. They‚Äôre so so comfortable and soft and lint/cat hair don‚Äôt stick to them at all! Just ordered the drawstring ones as well :)
3539,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Comfortable and a perfect fit. Wanted something a bit looser fitting than leggings and these are great. Plus they aren't super baggy like some sweatpants. They also have side pockets, something missing in a lot of women's leisure wear. Price is fantastic."
3540,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great basic Got these in a medium and I'm 150 lbs and 5'7. The fit is great, definitely tighter than looser but that's what I was looking for. Only down side is that they feel a little hotter than what I would like, especially for workout and hot weather. They make you sweat a lot but the fabric dries pretty fast."
3541,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Sweatshirt for cool days Russell has a reputation for great athletic shirts and this sweatshirt does not disappoint.  It is a warm and comfy layer that goes well with a T-shirt and/or a vest.
3542,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Ran small I normally wear an XL or size 14/16. It fit snug. I would size up 1 size. Love the material, it‚Äôs very side & washes well"
3543,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great fitting and quality Russell Athletic never disappoints me. I got a size L, i‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù and it‚Äôs the perfect fit for tall people."
3544,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Comfortable Comfort
3545,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Super cute dress!! I am 5 feet tall and 120 pounds and ordered the small. It fits absolutely perfect! I felt like it hugs all the right spots/very flattering. (My husband agreed). Also absolutely love the design on it. Super cute!
3546,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,great product this product fits as expected and is comfortable to wear in the gym. love it and will be ordering more
3547,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Nice Nice. I like them
3548,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Ok
3549,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,But the black ones there most slimming Working out
3550,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Fits snug Bought it for under my shirt, for a 3 x it would be a bit big but it is really skin tight"
3551,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,durable Got xlarge. Fit a little too big. Great feel and durable product.
3552,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Perfect especially being someone that workout..
3553,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Fits an athletic body nicely, and is holding up well despite many washes and some intense activity. go through many of these types of shirts per year, generally just running, biking, etc. My favorites are Nike and Adidas, but they've become quite costly. I thought that I would try one of these as a cheaper alternative, since all I do is ruin them with sweat anyway. So far, so good! The material seems to be on par with the others, and the fit is fine. It seems slightly less ""fitted"" than my Adidas, but doesn't look baggy or goofy. Just looks like a dry-fit tee. The shirt is good enough that I'm going to buy a few more. I'll know more by the end of the summer, but so far, this looks like a fantastic deal"
3554,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great for lounging and workout but beware of... Great for lounging and workouts but beware of boob peekaboos!<br />Washes well, no color fading so far, have had it for about a month and washed 2 or 3 times."
3555,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Amazing pants I am 5'11"" and 160lbs, and it can be very difficult to find pants that fit comfortably. I bought two pairs of these pants and I LOVE them- the waist sits comfortably high and the length is fine (a little above the ankle but with the jogger style it's fine). My go-to pants for rock climbing now, and very cute/comfy for casual wear. Will definitely buy again!"
3556,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars Fit as expected
3557,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Great quality!!
3558,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice colors Fits well but staticky.
3559,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Room to grow It was a little bit big in the chest for my daughter but she loves it anyways and will have room to grow!
3560,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love Love this hoodie
3561,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars COZY!
3562,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars My wife enjoyed them
3563,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,GREAT FIT! Fits great!<br />Will def be buying more!<br />The material is also mesh!
3564,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Four Stars Good product just a little big
3565,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Worth it! Just what I needed! I‚Äôm 130lbs and ordered a 3 pack of smalls. They are very fitted to my body (which I expected and wanted). The arms aren‚Äôt too small either. The white is slightly see through but only the white.
3566,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Husband loves this hoodie fit great
3567,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"nice cozy material, fit good and nice price"
3568,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Love my XL hoodie! I‚Äôve ordered two of these in black and one in blue because I like it so much. I‚Äôm a heavier guy (5‚Äô11‚Äù 250 lbs) and I have gynecomastia so I get insecure wearing certain clothing. This hoodie is made of a pretty thick cotton and so it flatters my body type pretty well (especially the black ones). Would recommend for other big dudes with body insecurities. Also, the material is durable and hearty. I love that the elastic wrist cuffs and elastic waist part have retained their tightness and not worn loose over time. Overall my favorite hoodie I‚Äôve owned."
3569,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Ice cream Dress dress is nicely shaped and soft.
3570,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great Fit and Performance Great fit. Daughter loves them and wears them underneath her soccer jersey for those cold winter games! They‚Äôve held up well so far after multiple wears and washes.
3571,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars There is nothing like a comfy sweatshirt in the winter.
3572,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"SO cute! These leggings are adorable and so freaking comfortable. They are made of this super soft, stretchy fabric that hugs everything perfectly and stays in place while not being too tight. Color seems true to the online photo and they seem to be squat proof. The only thing is with the fabric and fit, they seem prone to showing that ‚Äúv‚Äù crease and potentially a little camel, but you can always wear a longer shirt if that bugs you."
3573,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Form fitting, and very cute. I love these!!! When I pulled them out of the package I thought they would be too small. Form fitting and very cute."
3574,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Comfortable undershirt for healthcare workers I use these as an undershirt for my nursing uniform. Moisture wicking is moderate. Being a nurse can certainly compared to working out in some sense
3575,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,A little sheer but breatheable Great product for the cost! Will be buying more!
3576,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Muy c√≥modas y ligeras Excelente  Ropa de entrenamiento
3577,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Efficient shipping, product was as pictured. Excellent product."
3578,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Comfy I got them in winter but looking forward to wear in the summer.
3579,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Love it!! Super adorable dress! My daughter LOVES it!! Fits true to size.
3580,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Amazing fit! Amazing quality. Makes my body look so nice!!!ill be buying more colors
3581,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,LOVE Love these joggers!! Super cute and comfy
3582,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,One of the best sweatshirts I've owned. This is one great sweatshirt.  It fits a little big but I use it for work in construction and the extra room is appreciated. Very warm .
3583,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Looks cute with a bralette or sports bra if you are comfortable showing a little side skin I ordered a medium, I probably could have gone with a small. I have a shorter torso so no matter what size it is it will be a little long. It does go down low on the sides. Looks cute with a bralette or sports bra if you are comfortable showing a little side skin."
3584,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Well made product There is the old saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;,that applies here.I paid more for this sweatshirt than I would normally pay for a sweatshirt but I also received a great product. I own other Russell Athletic sweatshirts and I know the quality of their product."
3585,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Comfortable cool looking shirts. Fits perfectly and is made from quality material.
3586,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Beautiful Like it
3587,5,B0B16Q1854,1,LOVE LOVE LOVE Absolutely love these!  I have ordered three pairs so far. The black fit true to size. But the charcoal and gray fit a size too big. I plan to get every color!!
3588,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Comfy but color is off This is a very comfy, good quality sweatshirt. Would definitely recommend; however the color is more of a fluorescent pink than the hot pink shown."
3589,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,very good very good
3590,5,B0B16Q1854,1,very nice!! Fast delivery came in excellent condition
3591,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,My dad really liked this. I got it for him for Christmas ... My dad really liked this. I got it for him for Christmas and he said it was really comfy.
3592,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very Comfy Love russell sweatshirts I have worn them for years.
3593,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love it. Very comfy and makes you feel cute ... Love it. Very comfy and makes you feel cute in it. Feels like I could wear it every day.
3594,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Overall very pleased, but dark green is lighter than in the past Been wearing these Russell pullover hoodies for well over 20 years and just as good today as they've always been. Was totally bummed that I left my old green hoody, which I'd worn for over ten years and still looked new, in a rental car on a business trip so needed a new one. Can't beat the comfort, quality, or bang for your buck with these hoodies. I'm 6' 3&#34; and 160 lbs and an extra large fit perfect as it always has. Only gripe is that the dark green is a lot lighter than it used to be which I don't particularly like as much, but would still buy again."
3595,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love these joggers! True color and great fit.
3596,5,B09M6X79V9,1,great value I wear these all summer long playing tennis .  They fit perfectly and holding up well with lots of wear and washing
3597,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I love those shirts! They‚Äôre breathable and easy to wear I like everything about this shirt!<br />Aint nothing wrong with it
3598,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Good quality fabric and fit as expected.
3599,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I actually bought this dress one size larger due to ... I actually bought this dress one size larger due to the reviews stating that it was slightly small. This dress is flowy, it is actually true to size. I wish I would've ordered my true size  instead of ordering one size up as suggested by other reviews"
3600,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,It is a cute dress The material is not the fancy kind but comfortable. It's a bit loose fit for me but I like it. The pockets make it a bit more special. A very good summer vacation dress.
3601,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"THE Best These are the best leggings! I‚Äôve never had real Gymshark ones before and I don‚Äôt think I ever need to try them because these are amazing. I have a gray pair that I have had for almost 2 years that are still going strong and look great. And just recently got red ones. I am usually a median but I like to roll the waistband down, and they‚Äôre still high waisted. Also roll up the bottoms. I just got a small in the red and they fit perfect!! No rolling and they look so good and fit so well! Get all of them!"
3602,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Snugger fit Brighter colors
3603,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,I like It fit perfectly just little short side
3604,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Meh ***update*** It was too loose and it was way too short. It felt like a long cropped if that makes sense.  There‚Äôs no compression on it whatsoever. It might still work tho so I‚Äôll keep it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br />The color is nice. Not too light. It‚Äôs like a grey-ish blue.<br />I ordered an extra small in revival dusky pink and that one was perfect. The length was just right. The compression was perfect. It fit my body perfectly. The color was amazing. I‚Äôm not sure if the difference comes from the style? I‚Äôd stick to the revival line better.<br /><br />***update*** the seller contacted me and sent me another pair of leggings. Vital marl blue in XS. These leggings fit way better. Right out of the package you can see the difference. Great compression, great length, no baggy-ness. The seller was very helpful throughout this whole process! Highly recommend"
3605,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love it! This is a great dress!! The material is silky but sturdy; it's not sheer at all, and the dress still has some structure to it. I also was afraid it was going to wrinkle easily, but it doesn't. I'm 5'4"" and typically wear a size 12, the Large fits perfectly.  Definitely recommend."
3606,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Warm and just fot They just fit love the color and fabric. Pretty warm.
3607,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,These are a MUST! I honestly cannot get enough of these! This is my second pair and I‚Äôve gotta day- they are a must! The compression is just right and they‚Äôre squat proof. They‚Äôve got the right mixture of feeling like a workout legging and also being extremely comfortable. The color selection is great and both pairs I have so far have been exactly as pictured.
3608,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great! Bought these to wear under my scrubs. Normally wear and XL shirt and ordered them in an XL. They fit like a fitted XL shirt would. If you want compression then order a size down because you aren't going to get it at your regular size. I am happy with the fit of these and will order again
3609,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Perfect & confortable The dress is beautiful and-super confortable the size  S fit good for me I am 5,5 and 120 love my dress thanks"
3610,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Love em I wear medium but bought large and they fit great!
3611,5,B07XD71F1H,1,üôåüèª üëçüèªüëçüèª
3612,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Snug fit on chest and good desplay of back and delts! Fits great around chest,but makes your waist appear bigger,but the back design is amazing!"
3613,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars I'm tall so it's a little short but I love it
3614,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars These are great tanks to wear underneath other shirts.  Very slimming but the white is see through.
3615,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Nice! Order up in size unless you want a ‚Äòspanx like‚Äô top I‚Äôm glad that I read the reviews! I‚Äôm normally a size 6 but ordered the Large based on reviews and it fits nicely and still a little snug. I understand that it is meant to be a compression top but I like the feeling of a hug not a squeeze:-).
3616,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Best Quality Hoodie for the price I love these Russell Athletic hoodies since they‚Äôre great quality for the price. I am 6‚Äô0 tall and 200 lbs and a 2XL fit perfect. Pilling accumulates somewhat faster than I expected but it is not a huge deal. I will definitely be buying more of these.
3617,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"So cute! I sized up, as I always do online. I like a looser fit though. It fit really well and was exactly what I wanted. Looks great with black tights, just the right length (above knee). The flower on black print is absolutely adorable.<br /><br />Update:  I‚Äôve now worn and washed this about three times and the print faded significantly. The black background has a whitish shade to it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that to happen so soon. This might be a better item to buy in one of the lighter colors."
3618,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice Sweatshirt Nice, fast delivery. If you wear an XL then order a XL.....great fit."
3619,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Love this dress. Got tons of compliments on this dress...simple and super cute.
3620,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great shirts I wear these shirts all the time. Great fit and great colors.
3621,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Fun Will be a fun dress to wear. Throw on and go kind of style.  Feels nice on. Loose and comfy.

3628,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Excellent support and very comfortable to waer I loved everything about this product.  It is stylish, comfortable and gives you good support."
3629,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Workout and comfort and style with support These tank tops are perfect. They give me just the amount of support I need along with my sports bra to complete my exercises. They are excellent and easy to wash. I did not experience any shrinkage. They are also very true to your size.
3630,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Awesome This dress is awesome. Good quality .
3631,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice sweatshirt good price It is a loose but comfortable fit.  Perfect for casual wear, which is exactly what my husband wanted.  Good value too."
3632,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Overall: good buy Overall these were a good buy. I probably should have gotten a small over a medium but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. Will probably get more colors.
3633,5,B09M6X79V9,1,tight fit fits as expected - body hugging tank top
3634,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Run a but loose but it doesn't look bad at all It‚Äôs says fit or sometimes run smaller than regular size, that‚Äôs why I chooses the size M instead an S, however it‚Äôs run a bit big on me. But I decided to keep it and use it since doesn‚Äôt look bad at all though. Next time i‚Äôll By more but in size S"
3635,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Very Comfortable Comfortable, throw on and go."
3636,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"You will love these! I am obsessed with these pants! They are very similar to gymshark vital seamless, but feel lighter. They have compression so they are tighter on your stomach. I typically wear a medium, but ordered a small after reading reviews. My measurements are waist- 26 inches, hips 37 inches. These pants are squat and sweat proof.<br />I have convinced a few friends to buy these and got compliments at the gym. I‚Äôm already ordering more and I just got them today."
3637,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love it! The color is so vibrant I love it. It‚Äôs super comfy and ‚Äúteacher‚Äù wonderful.

3641,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great product Russell Athletic's always fit my husband well.  Why change when you found a winner with Russell Athletics.
3642,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfortable with the right amount of compression. Comfortable with just the right amount of compression.
3643,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Amazing affordable leggings! [[VIDEOID:4a15564558087984fa0f25d5c504fd84]] I‚Äôm a fitness instructor who works out daily so I‚Äôm always looking for cute fitness apparel that holds up. These are very comfortable for HIIT, weightlifting, etc and I do not have to pull them up. Very comfortable and flattering on! Will be purchasing more."
3644,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Soft and comfy Very soft. Fits well. Arrived ok, but was just stuffed in a mailer-no sealed plastic wrap. Previous same sweatshirts were tissued and sealed in plastic."
3645,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Will be buying more! Super cute! Also SQUAT PROOF. I am 5‚Äù1 and about 155 pounds. The color is amazing and the design on them is very flattering. Only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because I wish they were more compressive in general since I like a more put together feel but they are comfortable, and the light material seems breathable. The length isn‚Äôt too long for my short little legs considering I ordered a large."
3646,5,B009R09Z8W,1,The Garment Is Fine but the People Are Not Worth a Damn I attempted to order a second garment but 5 days into the process nothing had moved. I complained bitterly and was told if I didn't like how they did things to take my business elsewhere. Nothing will be easier.
3647,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Im ordering more Been searching all over for these under tanks! Dry fit.. stretchy .. nice!
3648,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love it Loose fit but very comfortable. Great for work.
3649,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Great hoodie.
3650,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Compliments every time I wear it Love it
3651,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Do it Love these!! Form fitting and a nice stretchy fabric. Better quality than expected! I got a small and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 130lbs and it fits great. About to order more colors!
3652,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Arrived as described  wish I bought a size up. It's very compressing almost uncomfortably so(my opinion) however if you like compression I do reccomend. The dark colors at least are not sheer so thats good. I bought the M and I 6'1"" at a out 138lbs so if tall and skinny is you they'll probably fit true to size. Considering I hate bras and want work tanks I wish I bought a large now but thats ok they are nice tanks and the material is lovely."
3653,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Pefect for a cat lover Got this dress for my 8yr at Easter. She loved it. She always gets compliments on it when she wears it. Fit as expected. Great quality. No issues.
3654,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Gym queen says YES I've only worn my shirt once and already have had several compliments on the style and color (blush)

3660,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable sweatshirt. I love Russell Athletic sweatshirts because they are soft and comfortable. I bought my sweatshirt in the middle of a weight loss regiment. It fits a little more loose than I like it but nice just the same.
3661,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great fit and light weight not bulky
3662,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Would buy again Fit was as described. Good quality and color retention. Have bought again.
3663,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Go ahead an buy 2 The only problem with this dress is trying to get my toddler to take it off. I'm most likely going to have to buy another so she can wear it while one is in the wash. Fits well. Light fabric. Washes well. Very fun and colorful print.
3664,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great Shirts! Was hesitant but glad I ordered them.  The fit was perfect and the material is very nice.  Someone complained about the shirts not being dryer machine friendly but honestly it took about 20 minutes to line dry.  I'm 6'1&#34; 190lbs, very fit and the large was perfect!"
3665,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"best workout tank, EVER! I usually wear a size medium but after reading some reviews, decided to order a size small instead and I LOVE the fit. this tank is so breathable, soft and moves easily with me during workouts. I have one in black and one in purple and can't wait to order another. super adorable and super comfy‚ô°"
3666,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"175lbs and XL fit great. Second purchase of items from this brand Just the right amount of compression so that I can wear it for long time - 8 hours. I'm 5' 11&#34;, 175lbs and XL fit great. Second purchase of items from this brand."

3677,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,I already send the Item through U P S  store. I didn't like the way the front of the dress look it's shorter than the rest of the dress I<br />ordered the V neck Boho Polka dot Long<br />Maxi dress  Please send me the right one.<br />with the hem not lifted up in front . everything else with the dress is good.but the lower front hem.
3678,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Cute Was a gift for my daughter and she loves them.
3679,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Loved it All of it was great
3680,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Legggggings (not really seamless but ok!) So far happy with the leggings. The material is better then I expected after reading some reviews. The waist band is super thick and at least 3 inches long. Bonus: they match my pink seamless bra that I have on in the photo. I tried to squat in them & they appear to be squat proof so far. I plan to wear them on a hike in the near future and will update my review with how they hold up. Overall I would recommend buying these & go for your true size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù5 and 148 and I ordered a medium. I have a smaller waist and a bigger but and hips. I hope this review helps! üòä‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

3704,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Slip and slide but alright alright Didnt give it 5 stars because they slip up and i have to pull them back down into place often unless i tuck them in which im not crazy about doing.  They slide up less when tucked in

3706,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"So comfortable! It is very flowy which is nice So comfortable! It is very flowy which is nice, but I also wear with a belt sometimes to look a little more put-together. I will be ordering more in other colors!"

3709,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great find Comfortable and warm and fits good.
3710,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Color may be a little off if you're matching something exact Perfect fit for my son which is unusual especially ordering online.

3717,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great for underneath a uniform shirt. I use these tanks under a uniform shirt.  They work well when it is hot outside to keep sweat from dripping down my back.  They are thin, slick, and stretchy...all things I was wanting in an under-tank. I ordered a M and it fits great.  I usually wear a L in women's shirts and a M in men's."
3718,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great comfort Excellent to wear alone working out - & very comfortable under -sweaters and shirts. Very happy with the quality after washing.

3721,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great Workout Tank Love the tank, I ended up buying another.  Very light and comfortable and a great tank for any kind of workout, not just yoga. I use it for cross fit and even running.  Worth the money."
3722,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Luse bien. Me quedo bastante bien, como lo esperaba. Comprobar√© su durabilidad."
3723,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,I originally ordered size to allow for shrinkage but that size was too large. Quality is excellent but size was too large. Have received correct size. Happy with one size lower

3728,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Size up this purchase was a gift for my spouse. My boyfriend is 5'7 about 185 lbs.I ordered a large for him.  He has been doing a lot of heavy weight lifting and Hiit works out, his back has widen and his shoulders and arms expanded. The shirts fit him great! they're open y cut in the back and his midsection is loose. Enough to lift, do jumping jacks and burpees comfortably. I will post a picture at the end of the week. The colors on the shirt are just as the picture, I opted for dark colors b/c when he's on the floor the gym floor stains the clothe and dark colors are easier to blend. Really like the product"
3729,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Love them!!
3730,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Happy Russell sweatshirt needed to be washed and dried completely in dryer to fit right. Love the puple color!!!!!! Happy happy.

3734,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Loved them! This was a gift for my son.  He loved them!
3735,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Nice goodie for running Great shirt if you're looking to go sleeveless and like to hood up at end of run.  I know, that sounds odd but it's actually kind of nice.<br />One thing though is this stitching around the mid line of the shirt was unexpected and took a moment to get used to and if shirt were tight would bug the who-de-who out of me."
3736,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great under scrub I use these for under scrubs and love them! I prefer more form fitting which is kind of hard to find if you want to be comfy at the same time. I‚Äôve ordered a few highly rated brands before coming across these and these are the best I‚Äôve found.
3737,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Measurements by Size We had a tough time knowing what size to order for our girl scout troop + troop leaders. We ended up ordering a bunch of sizes and returning the rest. I measured them all before sending them back in the hopes this would be helpful to others. Here they are:<br /><br />Youth L = 21"" (L) from neckline to bottom of sweatshirt x 18"" (w); sleeves = 20""<br />Youth XL = 24"" (L) x 19"" (w); sleeves 22""<br />Adult S = 22"" (L) x 19"" (w); sleeves 22""<br />Adult M = 24"" (L) x 21.5"" (w); sleeves 22""<br /><br />Overall, quality was great. Note that the youth sweatshirt does not have a drawstring on the hoodie. Certainly not a dealbreaker by any means."
3738,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Nice shirts Great shirts
3739,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"True to size athletic fit This is all I wear to the gym now. Great colors. Durable. Shows what you need, breathable after hours lifting. Size large for 5'11''. 200 lbs"

3744,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"These don't wash up nice Very comfortable but looked terrible after just one washing. The ""pilled"" up all around the crotch area. Super bummed I can only wear them around the house now."
3745,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,It will fit even if you‚Äôre short Love this dress. Easy to take care of. Quick iron job. Like 10 minutes and you‚Äôre done. Love the pockets. Nice/perfect for summer or just comfort. Hides my fat perfectly. Wear with a bra or not. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 about 145lbs. Had 2 kids so I have a belly to hide. The length is just perfect for flat sandals or wedge heels.
3746,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell Athletic Sweatshirt Four shirts were purchased for my grandson-in-law and he is very happy with them. The reviews said the sizes run big so I odered a LARGE (he had requested XL) and it fit fine.
3747,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell shirts and sweatshirts always fit great! Russell sweatshirts fit great and look good at the gym  or just hanging around!!!
3748,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"So I ordered So in these and they fit great, not to lose or to snug I am 5.7&#34; 210 pounds, I am kinda between a larger or Xtra large in shirts. So I ordered So in these and they fit great, not to lose or to snug."
3749,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Finally replaced my old worn-out work hoodie Very pleased with the size, quality and comfort. I will probably buy another in a different color just to have a little variety."

3757,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great jacket This hoodie is super soft on the inside, I just wanted something for work and it‚Äôs perfect. I normally wear an XL in men‚Äôs hoodies, it was just a little bit loose but it‚Äôs perfect for me! Highly recommend"
3758,5,B009R09Z8W,1,My favorite sweater. This hoodie is as exactly what I thought it would be. It fit me just right and it's so comfortable and soft. It keeps you very worm and I hate to even take it off lol. I bought a 5x because I'm a bigger guy I thought it would be to small but it fit perfect.
3759,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute soft sundress Looks  exactly as described in the description. Adjustable straps. I would buy a size up from what you usually buy. Soft flowing material. I got an extra large I‚Äôm 5‚Äô-8 1/2 and weigh 149 pounds. It‚Äôs higher in the front then in the back. Fixs nicely
3760,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Really nice These are great for the gym and fit me very well.  They don't get saturated with sweat like my cotton t-shirts do.  I purchased mediums and am 5'6"" / weigh 179 lbs (wrestler frame).  Like em' and will be purchasing more in a couple of months."
3761,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Worth the price Decent shirt and should hold up for awhile. Good for the price I just wish it was a tad longer. The fit is kind of stout.
3762,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"It‚Äôs a solid product I think the length is perfect, and the fit is better than decent. You won‚Äôt get hot in these; the mesh will keep you fairly cool. They also don‚Äôt look bad, and I‚Äôve seen a couple of other guys at the gym with the same tops and they seem to fit us all pretty well. Honestly, I think this is a good buy, you get 3 in this pack for a pretty good price and a solid product that‚Äôll last you."
3763,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great quality. True to fit; comfortable Like the spandex fit & water wicking. Do not care much for the red (blue red, not orange red as it looks in MY picture)."
3764,5,B09M6X79V9,1,fits perfectly! great combination of colors!
3765,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Breezy but not super see through 5'3""  175lb<br />The only thing I disliked is the way the strings to tie it up were so I cut the in half to tie them on both shoulders. Fit me perfectly!"
3766,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice brand Would buy again for sure . Nice tank tops for gym
3767,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fit just right Fit just right

3772,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Good value for the money Liked the fit, disliked the fat it displays"
3773,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Smaller size Returned. I loved this dress and still think it‚Äôs beautiful however in the picture it shows it tied in the front of the neckline however when I received this dress the tie was off to one shoulder and unable to be pulled thru to front. That may have been the reasoning it was too big on top because the tie was not where it shows it‚Äôs supposed to be in the picture.
3774,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Fits great arrived on time
3775,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Perfect zyia dupe! These pants are so amazing! They are flattering, very comfy, fits true to size and great for working out or lounging around the house. I have multiple pairs and recommend washing them on cold water, and air drying, helps prevent pilling. Great product, got my mom to buy a pair and my sister. Will buy more"
3776,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars MY SON WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT QUALITY IS VERY GOOD
3777,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great shirt This is a great, light weight workout top.  I got a medium and it fits nice and loose like shown."

3783,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Runs small I bought a size larger than I normally do based off the reviews and I'm glad that I did. It's still a little snug around my arms but not enough to be annoying. Super cute pattern, good cut. It's a thinner t-shirt material so it's good for layering."
3784,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable, fits well and warm Comfortable and warm"
3785,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Small! Too small. Ordered 3xl for my husband to wear loose. They are super small. He normally wears 1xl

3788,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"This is my favorite hoodie of all time This is my favorite hoodie of all time. I wear it as often as possible. The hood is a little snug, but that's fine with me. I wish there was a slightly lighter-weight one so I could wear it during the spring months."
3789,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars a little on the smaller size
3790,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Must have, last literally forever. I still have these years later and a thousand washes at least, these look exactly as they did the day I received them. One of the longest living products I own."
3791,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits like it should I really like these tops.
3792,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not snug, but still good. Really nice tank tops. But they don't fit snug like it shows in the picture. But still my daughter loved them and they're very cute and the fabric is nice."

3794,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Very comfortable and great fit. I am having surgery on my leg and will not be able to wear anything tight. These are kind of lightweight and comfortable. I have stitches now and pants are great. They fit right and are nor to snug. I bought a grey pair also so I can wear them to work while I have stitches in my upper leg.

3797,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Good value but imperfect The fabric is a little thick and scratchy and the fit is a little off. Not horrible and for the money these do the trick. Moisture wicking, snug and good for chilly day runs."
3798,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great for pregnancy! Absolutely love these tights!! I am 19 weeks pregnant and growing out of my clothes. I bought these because my normal yoga tights were cutting into my growing belly. I have never been picky with tights, I always just bought what I could find at TJ Max but after trying these on I am spoiled!! I will never go back! Not only are they great for my growing tummy but they completely cover up my panty line and there is no camel toe!!  I didn‚Äôt even know those two things were possible with yoga tights! Definitely will be ordering more!! I am normally a small but got these in a medium per the reviews and they fit perfectly! I am currently 145 lbs and 5‚Äô10‚Äù. I think these would still fit my normal 135 lb. self. So I recommend sizing up."

3833,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Incredibly comfy and durable I bought these probably three years ago, I like to wear them as undershirts, and after all this time they still fit! I have had no issues with them, so holes or tears. I think they may have stretched just a touch, but for someone who's been wearing them just about every day for three years, that's pretty amazing. They fit as described. I would definitely recommend!"

3840,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Choice Really nice, soft inside and out. Definitely order a size smaller, as most here recommend. I'm a standard size large (6'0, 170lbs, 16-34/35 dress shirt). The medium fits me perfectly, fits like a standard large size does. Very reasonable price, and no logo (just the V stitching at the neck, which is nice)."
3841,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Ok jogger Just not for me-I‚Äôm a short, athletic build and these were just not flattering. I love the fabric, love the pattern, love the pockets, but the fit is for a different shaped body than mine. I‚Äôm 5ft 3, 140lbs and ordered a medium. They fit perfect"

3883,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great workout tank I'm no small guy and I have never worn tanks because I just didn't like the way they looked on me. I've worn sleeveless and short sleeve in the gym and was finally to the point where i was so sick of my sleeves bunching up I to my arm pits that I decided to just order some for comfort. I will never go back. These are kind of a jersey type material (with holes) but much more comfy than the practice jersey mesh crap we had back in the day. They're light, breathable and I barely notice it's there when I'm lifting.  I ordered an XXL and it fits perfectly. I even have a little bit of a beer belly (thus the wokouts) and it hangs loose enough it isn't prominent. For reference my chest is 55"" and waist is 40"" neck is 20"".  My gf also likes these so there's that added bonus. I actually came here to order more colors and the shorts to match but ""squirreled"" and left a review.<br /><br />TLDR: Great shirt, great fit, great price. Gym tested, GF approved. 10/10 buying again"

3922,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love SQUAT PROOF ! Love these leggings fits so nice I am 5‚Äô5 and 128lbs and the size Small & Xsmall fit great !!! I have the Royal Blue Marl in size small and the Indigo Marl in size Xsmall. I have still quite a bit of love handles left to loose / trim and town down so in the future I will probably stick to the Xsmall size if I keep up with my fitness journey!! But both size for great and I am going to buy all the colors in the Marl style !!!
3923,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"These are the best hooded sweatshirts in the world. Would still be a great vale at twice the price! These Russell Hoodies are the very best hoodies you can buy for the money.<br /> I purchased a Carhart & a North Face Hoodie at the same time as this one. The North Face was $55 bucks, & the Carhart was $70...  These Russel ones are better than BOTH of them. The fabric is higher quality, they fit better, after washing the shape holds up PERFECTLY.<br /> I WILL NEVER EVER buy ANY other kind of hoodies. EVER!<br /> After getting this one & seeing how GREAT it held its shape after washing & drying it, I bought this same sweatshirt in White, Navy, Black, Royal, Cardinal red (cool shade btw) & Forest Green. I also bough TWO white ones... because I'm a slob, but I LOVE white.<br /> These fit true to size, & run just a tiny bit big upon arrival, but after washing in warm & running through the dryer, they fit absolutely perfect for how a Large Hooded Sweatshirt should fit.<br /><br /> You will not regret making this purchase. In damn near any color... These would STILL be an excellent value in the $45 dollar price range.<br />My son loved them when he saw mine as well so I bought him an array of colors like mine. He wears them constantly. AND, they hold up VERY WELL to the abuse a 17 year old crazy active boy puts them through. These not only look & feel GREAT, but are high quality, & very sturdy.<br /> 100% recommend, you cannot go wrong here, so long as you order the proper size.<br />Two Thumbs, 8 fingers, & Ten Toes UP!!  ALL THE WAY UP!"
3924,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,great lounging gown great beach cover up.  I love lounging around the house in it..Material is soft and pockets hit right at the hip....I do love my pockets

3928,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great fit Good quality! Recovering from shoulder surgery,  needed tanks to match my loose fitting tops. Great fit and comfort."
3929,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice and smooth and a but slippery to wear Its too slick n slippery when wearing it.  Used it for working out in spin class although it's a great fit and slimming to the figure but should not be considered as a body contouring item like it suggests. It's not tight enough to make a difference in body contouring while working out. I kept the product because the colors n looks slimming and also I hate returnung things that I buy online.
3930,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice fabric good fit and nice color options; my brother loved the purple
3931,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars super comfy and soo cute!!

3933,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"True to size Love it, just ordered a pink one too. True to size."
3934,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sweatshirt fits in length I bought these products for working out at my local gym.  Many of the sweatshirts I have had from competitors are too short in the body.  These fit well.
3935,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Five Stars Love, love, love this dress!!"
3936,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"True to size Such a comfortable, soft fabric. The shirt is true to size. Seems like a good quality shirt. Hope it lasts me a long time cause I love it."
3937,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Stay warm on colder winter days and nights. Bought to keep me warm on cold winter nights and it did the job.
3938,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"OMGosh I LOVE this dress OMGosh I LOVE this dress!!!!  This dress is soooooo flowy (yes it's a word!) & comfortable.  I'm 5' 7', 130 & the material lays perfectly so it does NOT look like a moo moo!  The POCKETS (whaaaaat- YES!) & adjustable straps are a huge bonus too.  Don't wait - just get one - you'll be glad you did!"
3939,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars like the feel
3940,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I have to hand wash them on my travels so the 3 pack lasts me a week. Well made! What a great to go tank top. It‚Äôs my go to top for travel. Breathes a lot so low odor! Quick drying and light.
3941,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good Pretty good. Kept me warm during outside activities. And good strong compression. I recommend.

3944,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Satisfecho Buen material y comodas
3945,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Almost perfect Pros-<br />‚Ä¢Good color<br />‚Ä¢material is nice on the skin<br />‚Ä¢lightweight<br />‚Ä¢very slimming (confidence boosting for sure)<br />‚Ä¢sleeves don't stretch out when pulling up and down<br /><br />Cons-<br />‚Ä¢sleeves are a bit short on the arm by about 3 inches<br />‚Ä¢the torso part of the shirt is not as long as I like and it rides up<br /><br />Overall I like the shirts alot. I wear it under my scrubs as a undershirt. I just need to keep the shirt tucked into my pants to mostly avoid the whole shirt from riding up to my chest. I probably would not reorder due to that but otherwise it's a great deal on almost perfect shirts.
3946,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"GREAT UNDER SHIRTS, WOULD WORK WELL AS JUST A SHIRT AS WELL GREAT SHIRTS, I HAVE WORN TWO ALREADY IN THE TWO DAYS I HAVE HAD THEM. IM WEARING THEM UNDER A SHORT SLEEVE TSHIRT"
3947,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Very good addition to your active wardrobe! I liked the look online and in person.  The fit is nice and if high waist is flattering for you, these are the pants to buy .  I like the material, they wash nice and I wear them often."
3948,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Size is correct It fit perfect to expectations
3949,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,I want every color Looks like very expensive joggers and feels amazing. Ordered another pair
3950,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"My favorite dress I‚Äôve bought off Amazon . I love that the straps are adjustable, and because of the ‚Äúkerchief‚Äù like hemline, I feel this dress would look great on women of many different heights. It is also super flattering around the bust area, without showing too much. I bought the red polka dot one and it is pretty spot on to Minnie Mouse colors."
3951,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Soooo breathable!  Love it. Order a med. tied a not in front since it Alittle baggy around the waist. Love it.

3953,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,hoodie perfect fit for christmas gift
3954,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"The best compression undershirts I've worn I will start off by saying that I have purchased a couple different brands with the goal of identifying the best overall compression A-shirt. This brand is by far, the best I've worn. The shirts have the perfect snug fit (perfect when wearing fitted clothing) and they maintain their integrity thru multiple wash cycles. Where other brands become a bit loose fitting. The comfort is amazing. I have settled on this brand for my wardrobe moving forward. Still waiting for the 3-pack red colored setüëçüèæ"
3955,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great product I was pleased by the overall quality of the product. I have a big upper body (52 inch chest). Order the XXL and it fit perfect. It‚Äôs long enough to be tucked in your pants so it won‚Äôt roll up over the mid section. I will be ordering again but will stick with the black since reviews of the other colors has not been as favorable.
3956,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfect fit and style Not much to say, it's just nice tank top that fits and feels good.  I wish they had more color options."

3958,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Great comfy sweats My favorite comfy sweat pant ever
3959,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Good quality; fits pretty true to size. I ordered a single tank so I could gauge whether or not it was worth it to buy three of them. I definitely will be ordering a three pack! These really are great for workouts. For reference, I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù, 136 pounds, and a 36D. I ordered the small and it fits well. I will probably size up to a medium so that I will have a little bit more room, but the small does fit me! If I had to be picky, I would say that the material is a little bit thicker than I would like. It‚Äôs not one of the soft, flowy, vintage materials. It is a little thinner than a normal T-shirt. That‚Äôs just preference, though, nothing wrong with the actual shirt."
3960,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Took some getting used to but overall not terrible for the Really weird sewing lines. Instead of going down your sign it crosses across where your hips/hip bones would be. Took some getting used to but overall not terrible for the price

3964,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Good fit Good fit. Waist sets perfect not to high.
3965,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Be cautious of sizing The marbled tops fit perfectly but the solid color one are incredibly small. The tags say they are the same size but they definitely fit like two sizes smaller.
3966,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very comfortable I like this sweater, its warm and soft, i read the reviews before buying, it gave me some insight, i will buy another when its time"

3996,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Completely squat proof. Such quality for the price !! I absolutely love these. They hug you so well!  The material is thick enough to be squat proof but light enough to not make you feel like your legs are in a sauna in the summer. They are completely squat proof and I purchased the light blue colour. Due to the light colour you definitely can see the sweat, I had it at bottom of my spine and between my thighs( but then again it was a very hot day in the gym), but it feels like it would dry up pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend these for everyone and want these in every single colour."
3997,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Awesome for the price Great sweatshirt, especially for the price.  Midweight, fits as expected, and very comfortable.<br /><br />I recommend it."

I'm a XL/XXL generally and I ordered the US Large and it fits perfectly."

4047,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great quality for the price! feels expensive These joggers are amazing. They are very soft, more silky like, and the quality feels far more expensive than the price. However I would say they were in a little bit big. I am thicker on the bottom half and figured a large would be good, also considering I just had a baby a month ago. I think I could‚Äôve went with a medium though. I am 5‚Äô4 160. The large fit but we‚Äôre a little bit baggy"

4060,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,These joggers are great for dog owners These joggers fit great and are so comfortable. But the best thing is that they don't pick up dog hair. I have a Golden Retriever who sheds a lot. I don't have to use a lint roller every time I leave the house.
4061,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Favorite pair of joggers These are seriously the BEST joggers. I am 117lbs; 5‚Äô3 and I ordered a small and extra small. I like the fit of the extra small. They are loose in the legs and perfect in the ankles and waist just like joggers should be. The pockets are great and they are also extremely soft and stretchy. By far my favorite pair of pants. I have ordered 3 pairs.

I'm 5'10 and they fit where I would expect joggers to, as they are not too short (woot woot!!).  The quality is great and the color is accurate.  The clearly aren't going to keep me warm (in MN) but would be a great option for a 60*-80* day or to wear around the house."

4100,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice hoodie Very nice quality fabric and warm. The print is just as pictured. I ordered a bigger size so it would fit long to go over my stretchy pants but I would say the sizing is right as expected from a garment made in the USA
4101,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Does hold you in They are comfortable and hold you in.
4102,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Love them!
4103,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Four Stars great fit, nice and solid appearance"
4104,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great tanks If you have a little extra around the waist you may want to size up so they don‚Äôt rise up on you at the waist. Other than that, these are great tops!"
4105,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Perfect! Favorite work out leggings! Super cute for every day wear or just to work out in! Love them holds in everything.
4106,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love it! I absolutely love this dress! It is the perfect summer time outfit.
4107,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Definitely worth trying! I'm a 29"" waist and a 40"" hips and these fit great and are squat proof. I got the vital violet/purple color. Only thing i can say is the waist is a little more compressive then I'm used to but it definitely holds you in."
4108,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Just as shown Its just so beautiful
4109,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Great product. Nice and warm. I would order again in a different colour.
4110,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Holds up well and great price I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3 with at 52 ‚Äú chest wear a 2xl and it fits as it should. It‚Äôs large and loose not to baggy. Lite weight and wicks away sweet.  This is my second time purchasing this product. Still have all the tanks from the first order just added more colors. Hold up well even after everyday use at the gym for over a year.
4111,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Good leggings. Very good leggings. Strong and flexible fabric.
4112,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Comfy Comfy and flattering
4113,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Infusible ink (and nursing!) compatible The high polyester content makes this tank infusible ink compatible for anyone out there wanting to make a shirt without using the cricut branded shirts. It is much cuter than your basic tshirt, especially when paired with a bralette. I also needed a shirt for nursing and the large armholes make this shirt easy for that. Highly recommend for any moms wanting to make matching shirt/onesie with their baby!"
4114,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Four Stars Love the material it's so soft, but a tad see through"
4115,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Buy the 3 pack. Love it. I'm petite and I was concerned that with the loose style of this top it would fall off of me while working out. It fits well.  I wish I would have bought the 3 pack.
4116,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Quality is great especially for the price. I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù and normally wear a small or small-tall. I sized up per recommendations and ordered Medium and they fit perfectly.
4117,5,B09M6X79V9,1,The material Looks great on
4118,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Gym tanks for days Bro Nice tanks for the gym at a great price. Very breathable!  Im 6 feet tall 180lbs. I normally wear a size Large shirt and a size medium tank top. I got these in medium and they fit perfect.
4119,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Sweats Wear them all the time I sleep in them as well they are great
4120,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Good quality vs price..perfect Fit and confortable..
4121,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Comfortable Product is comfy and fits nicely
4122,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good fit Fit was good. Use these as undershirt for work.
4123,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Good material and the fit is true to size Good material and the fit is true to size. However the stitch that goes across the torso is tight and makes the fabric kinda bunch up near said stick. So basically it makes it look kinda weird. Stick with the all black because is less noticeable.
4124,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Let me clarify... These tank tops get all the stars!  They're cute with that subtle color along the top.  They are the perfect tanks to wear underneath your tops.  That being said, they are NOT compression tanks.  If you just need a fly tank that fits great and serves that tiny pop of color, this is perfect!"
4125,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Excellent! Super happy with these shirts! Great quality and is better than the picture
4126,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good fit Gym wear

4131,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,A great warm jacket! Great jacket. It is comfortable and keeps me warm.
4132,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"So hotüòçüòçüòç The fit is exactly how I wanted it to be, TIGHT! The material is perfect for working out and staying flattering during a good sweatüòâ"
4133,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Super comfy These are really comfy, I ordered a large and they fit true to size. I got the marine colored leggings and they are really pretty in person. They fit and hug my curves and the best part is that they‚Äôre seamless and squat proof. Would definitely buy another pair in a different color."
4134,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars Really cute and fits perfect.
4135,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Soft & Comfy Got this for my husband. He loves non-branded items, won't wear anything with a logo on it. Comes in many different colors and they're great quality."
4136,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good material. Good work out Shirt.
4137,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Good I bit larger than expected,  but overall great material."
4138,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Do I cut it???? [[VIDEOID:733423fc760aedc40015314689b1123f]] Great workout clothes. Sadly sometimes the quality check is missing. Am I supposed to cut this extra piece of fabric off or return it?
4139,5,B009R09Z8W,1,tye dye sweatshirt My 10 year old Grandson loves it!!!!
4140,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Works well under shorter sleeve shirts for additional warmth & coverage A little too warm for working out. Use under short sleeve shirts for warmth and works great. Not sure about in sun.
4141,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love them! Love them!!
4142,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfy Comfy for lounging around.
4143,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Love the color, a little big for a medium A little big for a medium, but haven't washed it yet so it may shrink..love the color and the soft fabric!"
4144,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Value! Nice sweatshirt for the $$$... Serves the purpose well, at least for me. Kind of an all weather sweatshirt, barring harsh winter days.<br />The zipper is not a heavy duty zipper and can sometimes come through defective. The stitching on the pockets can also pull away easily but Russell usually stands for quality. I have a Russell Sweatshirt that I still wear from 1982.<br /><br />If Russell could fix the zipper setting so it does not lay above the double zipper molding, I would give this sweatshirt a 5 star rating. When looking at the sweatshirt, the zipper should not be the main feature. The zipper should be sewn in more recessed.<br /><br />I ordered XL and it fit perfect. Sleeves, shoulders, neck, hood and exactly right to the waist."
4145,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Hoodie Nice material, fits as expected. Will purchase more."
4146,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Very nice and cool looking Is fine
4147,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Sleeves are short The sleeves are really short but the rest of it fits well and is a good material
4148,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Red ink bled on other clothes... Great shirts.  Biggest complaint is that the red dye bled even after multiple washes in cold water.  WASH ALONE!  Otherwise, durable, good fit (not too short on average length torso)."
4149,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice sweatshirt! Nice product! Well worth the buy!
4150,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,üëçüèΩ üòç .
4151,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Best Hoody I have ever had! The hoody is super comfortable and soft with great insulation to keep the chill out.  Thank you!
4152,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Good for everyday, but not fancy to go out."

4155,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"makes Traps look bigger love that it shows traps and back, but doesn't show any nips."

4160,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,very light The dress is a little on the thin side; the fabric is kinda see through. I wouldn't wear it by itself but with the right accessories it will be a very light dress for summer
4161,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Not everyone wants to wear crop tops! These are my go-to gym tops. I cant say much on the moisture wicking because I bought the pack in black, but they‚Äôre very soft and flattering. The material and stitching are good quality as well. 10/10"
4162,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great comfy hoodie Got this for my son.  He‚Äôs 15 and about 5‚Äô7‚Äù.  Got him a mens large.  Fits him good.  Has a little room but not to baggy.  Perfect for him.

4181,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Compression shirt I got the compression shirts because my doctor said it would help my blood pressure. I have low blood pressure. So we are going to see overtime if it helps a little bit with my blood pressure. Shirts are comfortable to wear. Would buy again.
4182,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great I ordered a small and it fit great, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1, and weight 125lb, nothing to envy to gymshark"

I'm 4ft 11 and big chested (42DDD) so I was worried it wouldn't fit around my breast area but did. I had seen other reviews about how the seem is in the front but i was actually able to just flip it around and it fit the same. Pockets were definitely the cherry on top!"

4198,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Four Stars So comfortable
4199,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Good product, especially for the price. This is a light, nice fitting hoodie.  Excellent to ‚Äúshowcase your guns‚Äù‚Ä¶Hood is great to pull up when lying in the flat bench. Material is durable enough.  You can throw on a shirt under them, looks cool as well.  I get looks and compliments in this shirt, I have every color they make now.  For less than 10 bucks/ shirt, they‚Äôre a no brainer, seriously. I‚Äôve been recommending them to friends and have gifted a few guys with these as well. Only advice, don‚Äôt by a size down, buy whatever size you‚Äôd normally wear in a comfortable hoodie.  I tried a size smaller than I usually wear (I wear XL, tried L) and it was too tight."

4207,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Five Stars Very comfortable shirts, love to workout in them and lounge around the house when doing chores in them also."
4208,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great Product When I pulled them out of the packaging I was expecting them not to fit, but they have a lot of stretch in them! I love the fabric, it's breathable and I like the feel of it on my skin. Sometimes the more slick and shiny fabrics can bother my skin after awhile, but I feel like I could wear these all day.<br />Quality is good, I'd say they are decently thick. I've worn and washed them quite a few times now and haven't had any issues with seams coming loose. If you are a size small typically I'd say order your size. I'm typically a size small in Gymshark if that helps."

4231,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Nice Good for those slightly cool times when a t-shirt or tank shirt isn't enough and a light jacket is too much.
4232,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Gives added support Slight compression without being too tight

4244,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Slightly tight & not warm I like the shirts and they are a good value.  If you are looking for warmth this is not the product you should buy.  Also, buy a size larger than you think you need they run on the small side."

4252,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,... was too small for me but worked as a great gift for someone else This was too small for me but worked as a great gift for someone else.

4254,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Very comfortable and figure flattering I ordered a xxl because I have big arms. That was my main concern. I normally wear a size 12 top. This top has plenty of room for my arms. The sleeves are very long they cover my hands. But I just scrunched them up. The colors are very vibrant.

4264,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Sweatshirt This hooded sweatshirt is very comfortable, and its quite warm - in fact it is warmer than I originally expected. I wear this regularly outside when I am working. I'm a bigger guy, so I usually order my clothes in the large size but with this sweatshirt I probably could have gone with a medium, but it's nice to have extra room. The hood is thick, and keeps your head warm on cold and windy days - and the thickness prevents it from being blown off your head by strong gusts. The pocket in the front of the sweatshirt is very large, and can hold many items at once. However, it is slightly expensive, and certain colors are more expensive than others. I give this sweatshirt four stars."
4265,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Will buy more Very pleased. Exactly what I expected. Comfy. Soft

This is what sold me on this dress. I bought an XL and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'5 and it hits just at my ankles. Its the perfect length. Not too long to where I'm going to trip on it and not too short to where I don't feel comfortable calling it a Maxi dress. The color is perfect too. The fabric is light and will be comfortable for summer.
4287,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Perfect under shirt for scrubs! These are perfect for wearing under my scrubs it just a layering shirt for outdoor hiking. It‚Äôs moisture wicking and warm. Love these!
4288,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect gift for Dad I bought this for my dad because his previous one that he was overly attached to was to beat up. It is actually a very very deep blue it‚Äôs almost black. So I would not say that this is particularly a navy blue it‚Äôs more of a blue black. But the fit is great and every time I visit my parents my father is wearing this lol
4289,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfy This is comfy. Fits well
4290,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"GREAT HOODIE FOR WOMEN TOO Other hoodies made for women always sit right on top of the waist of the pants,  I prefer them to go down further in length to go down over some of the butt and these do. Not looking to be cute but warm :)  For other females buying this im 5'8, 190 (gym rat) and I originally bought the XL,  The XL was a tad to big but i can wear it over heavy winter sweaters. I then ordered 2 large hoodies ( cardinal  and new navy) and they fit perfectly.  I really like the Cardinal color one.<br /><br />These are well made and warm, quite pleased with the purchases."

4311,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Order up if you have loose skin on your tummy or carry your weight in your tummy Positive part first, these are very comfy, squat proof, and flattering for small booty women. No camel toe, but there is a single camel. I will be buying more. Now the negative. I am 5'4"" 125lbs, but carry my weight in my tummy. I have loose saggy skin in my tummy region from losing 60lbs. I ordered a size small, but wish I had ordered a medium due to the waist band pushing my loose skin into an unsightly bulge in my tummy area. I look 5 months pregnant! I would love to see a version with better tummy control for those of us with loose skin on our tummy from losing weight. I will order a medium in the future to see if that solves the tummy bulge problem. I will likely keep this pair for later on in my fitness adventure. Still a five star rating."

4348,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"amazing gymshark vital seamless dupe, not 100% squat proof but pretty good for a light color such a good vital seamless dupe! When I first took them out of the package I said, ""these look like they were made for a child!"" but they actually fit true to size and are very stretchy (I got a small). I got them in the light green marl color; in real life the color is more of a dusty teal, not as icy of a light blue but still very similar. Being such a light color, they are not fully squat proof, but with nude underwear, there isn't anything noticeable through the leggings. the waistband is really thick and compressive with good tummy control but doesn't dig in. I love these leggings and would recommend them to everyone! brb about to buy them in every color"
4349,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Comfy and cute I thought the shirt would always be wrinkly. Surprisingly, it‚Äôs not! It fits super well, and when tied in the back, the opening is just the right size."

I bought it for my husband who works nights and needs to move a lot. These have been the best but now my teens take his hoodie. They will be getting some when it gets cold.<br /><br />The teens love these which you know teens can be difficult and refuse to wear jackets but these are thick and warm for them.

4358,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,This has always been the perfect sweatshirt. I took this sweatshirt from my mom in the 80s and I still wear it. Then my husband tried to take it from me and I decided to buy him this new one. I hope it holds up as well as my mom's sweatshirt. Not much has been changed about the design since then. Even the color is an exact match. I also bought a few more colors.

Wow, am very pleased! Like another reviewer, I found that wearing the tied keyhole on the back worked best for me. Such a comfortable and pretty dress. Not heavy, and not flimsy either."

4378,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Long enough! Actually fit and aren‚Äôt super duper short. I ordered the x-small which most of the time with other leggings end up fitting like capris on me but these actually reach all the way down to about 1‚Äù above my ankle bone. That‚Äôs an absolute miracle!! Love them! My only complaint is that the stitching on the ankle of the leggings isn‚Äôt stretchy so getting them over my size 10 feet was tough.

I kind of wished they had a XXL to be a little more roomy for me but XL was also perfect too. I usually am self cautious about my body so to wear something that is a bit tight fitting is sort of uncomfortable but I know I'll be able to handle it.

4414,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars thank you! for fast delivery .keeps me real warm ..thumbs up!
4415,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Nice item Bought this for my wife and she loves how it fits and she looks amazing in it!
4416,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfect with Pockets! I'm 5'10, ~170 lbs, pear shaped. This dress is amazing. It's a loose, flowy fit. Flattering on all body types, I ordered this for my stepmother and she's 5'4 and it was just as flattering. Highly recommend it."
4417,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Very good quality
4418,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Absolute adorable purchase. For a woman,  this fit great! Loved the purchase and will buy more.. great colors."
4419,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great fit, comfortable, and just the right firm fit I've tried some of the other compression style shirts and these are super easy to wear, with little extra heat and just the right amount of support.  Like other reviews, when i first got it i was wondering if the compression is enough.  Easy to put on and light weight.  Would suggest this."
4420,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Bottom works up The only thing that is disappointing the bottom rides up so you have to pull down often but the material is good and the sizes true
4421,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Very cute I ordered a small but it still fit a bit loose. I wore this to the gym but I was able to tie a knot on the side, and had no other problems w it."
4422,5,B0928FSGGD,1,So awesome I bought in every color Had to buy 3-4 packages to get every color. Fits great and I love them. So comfortable
4423,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Four Stars nice
4424,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good Good
4425,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"I bought a pack and wear one at least twice ... I bought a pack and wear one at least twice a week. I was worried about it being clingy but it‚Äôs so comfy and breezy, I plan on ordering more colors soon"
4426,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,My Favorite! I bought these to work out in and also just walk around the house in. These are truly my favorite. They dont give you the appearance of having a camel toe (like alot of others some how do). They don't make your legs itchy and they fit just right. I bought 2 pairs so far and plan to buy more down the road.
4427,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Absolutely in LOVE!!! [[VIDEOID:c5e7608ff60721aa21509e09925aca02]] I have a several colors of these leggings. That are, hands down, my favorite! For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and about 130lbs."
4428,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Great quality! These hoodies are exactly as advertised. They are great quality. Not cheap and not so heavy they're bothersome. Perfect! The XL was larger than a normal extra large. So if you're second-guessing just know the XL is a ""large"" XL if that makes sense. The XXL was very roomy!!!"
4429,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,I love these sweatshirts! I‚Äôve been wearing theses for years
4430,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Light Comfortable!
4431,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Thank you Good
4432,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Very comfy and perfect fit! I like that I can pair these with a hoodie or a t-shirt.  Can make a quick run to the store and not have to change if it's a stay at home situation.  Would buy again, great price.  I got a pair of the pink ones, be warned, they are more of a deep coral color and it's difficult to find a top to match."
4433,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,180 pounds and large fits perfect fits great and love the open back
4434,5,B0B16Q1854,1,It fits and its comfortable Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it
4435,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Awesome jacket Love everything about it; the price, the comfort and the fit. Is as good or better than UA and other higher priced brands. Arrived too big but after one washing it fits perfect. Don't want to take it off!"
4436,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Runs small Well fitting. Comfortable. But one size up.
4437,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Holding up Super thin but hasn‚Äôt ripped so far. Stays up and flattering
4438,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very comfortable sweatshirt I purchased this sweatshirt to replace my previous one which I have had for nearly ten years. I enjoyed the comfort and fit of that one that I wanted to make sure I ordered the exact same sweatshirt again and, fortunately, I was able to. I was pleased to find that the new one fit just as well and was just as comfortable as the previous one and it does. I'm very please. And, it's durable too- the only reason I replaced the old one was because I got paint and various stanis all over it."
4439,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Color is different than pictured Love Russell hoodies. I ordered this one because of the bright blue pictured. It's actually a very dull gray blue, looks nothing like what the picture shows. No big. I'll keep it."
4440,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars great quality, fast delivery, very happy - will be a repeat customer!"
4441,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Workout tanks Great product for the gym or anywhere! Fit as expected and a great price for 3

4447,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Cheap, comfortable sweatshirt Comfortable, cheap, and warm sweatshirt. Exactly as I expected."
4448,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Material isn‚Äôt what I was looking for The compression isn‚Äôt what I wanted and I‚Äôm not crazy about the material of them but They are as described and the colors just like the picture. I was honestly hoping this was the tank top with the ridged material but it was not.
4449,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars This is great, better than expected. true to size. Will buy more!"

4459,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Its like someone designed it just for me! This dress fits perfect.  It's like it was tailored just for me. Im normally a large but measured myself and went with the xlarge. Take the time to measure. You will be glad you did. This  dress is made to accent breast and bottom of curvy women.

4468,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,shirt my husband wears this shirt to the gym all the time
4469,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Amazing knockoffs of expensive gym wear brand Amazing Gymshark knockoffs! My best friend has Gymshark leggings and these look almost identical to hers minus the logo. The fabric is also a little more stretchy which is a plus. The only down side is that these run a little big - I got an XS and the waist is definitely too big on me but not terrible enough that I‚Äôd return them, the legs and butt area fit great. I just have to roll them down at the top. For reference I‚Äôm 116 pounds and 5 foot 1 with a rounder athletic butt and small waist."
4470,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Very comfortable and fits great!

4480,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Made well Nice mid weight hoodie wear all the time
4481,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Perfect! I'm 5'11&#34; at 162 lbs, and the Larges fit me perfectly.  They're snug, but not too tight.  I use them as t-shirts under my uniform, and they're cooler than cotton.  Also, some reviews say they're super-thin, but they're actually sturdier than I expected.  Great deal, great product!"
4482,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Comfortable Good
4483,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Fits true to size, Great fabric/Quality! Awesome Value for the Money . Light weight , Great fabric used . Very comfy and fits well. Im a medium and medium fits perfect. Definitely recommend üëçüëç"
4484,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Super comfortable and good quality I currently own 3 of Joe's USA Men's Hoodies Soft & Cozy Hooded  rainbow tie dye Sweatshirts in various sizes.  The coloring is fantastic and the sweatshirt is good quality.  If I could live in this sweatshirt every day I would, it is that comfortable."
4485,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Fits perfectly. I'm a size ten so I ordered ... Fits perfectly. I'm a size ten so I ordered a large and it fits perfectly.. Have gotten many compliments.. Order it!!! Worth the money!!
4486,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Fitting Fits well !! Nice material though is thin but it does keeps body warm !!
4487,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Get Them Purchased these for my niece to use under her soccer uniform. They are well made and fit well. We purchased the black, grey and white set, we are considering purchasing more."
4488,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,fits fits and looks great
4489,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Lightweight and comfortable These are so lightweight and absorb sweat from high intensity workouts. They are easy to move around in and look great on as well.
4490,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good for running. I ordered these with hopes of wearing them to yoga. The shirts are not fitted at the bottom and are a little short, so they come up in poses. They're comfy, just not what I expected."
4491,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Just buy it Good shirt good price can‚Äôt go wrong
4492,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Basic sweatshirt Hard to find basic gray sweatshirt.<br />I am very pleased at the quality and price.
4493,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great pants! Love! The only thing is they ride a little low in the back. Other than that they are PERFECT
4494,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Good quality- stretchier than Gymshark, not a perfect match for the Aoxjox Vital charcoal top Love the product. I can tell a small difference between these and Gymshark vital in that these seem to have a little more stretch. I also purchased the Aoxjox Vital long sleeve top, hoping that even though the colors appear slightly different on the Amazon pics they would make a match. There is a slight color variation (the top has a slightly darker shade of charcoal marl), it's still close enough for me :)<br />Love the price point!"
4495,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"One of the best leggings I‚Äôve ever purchased! Great quality, price is on point, true high rise that doesn‚Äôt roll when doing squats, no camel toe, not see through.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 125 lb and the XS is perfect with just enough compression!  Length is perfect as well.  Much better quality than most leggings that are three times as expensive!"
4496,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"very short Ummmm its ok.... cute but not as advertised, very short."
4497,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars good
4498,4,B076QD9NP1,1,"Cute; twirly; a little thin; big armholes Daughter *had* to have this as her dress for a school glow dance.  She's almost 7, is taller, but has a petite frame.  Finding clothes that she'll actually wear AND that fit is difficult.  39#, 48.5"" height, 21"" bust, 19.5"" waist.<br /><br />That said, I read all the reviews and took a wild guess and ordered two sizes (4/5 & 6/7) and crossed my fingers.  She wears about a 4 in waist size, but is a 7 or 8 in leg length.  For dresses, I usually put her in a 5 as a 6 gapes way too much on her.<br /><br />For this dress, the 4/5 worked better for us.  It still drapes too loose on her, the waist sits a bit too high, and the armholes are borderline too big.  Length is a probably a couple inches above the knee (guessing as she wouldn't stand still).<br />The 6/7 fit better in where the waist hit and the length wasn't really much different than the 4/5 (1/2"" to 1"" more maybe), but the armholes were WAY too big and the fit was even more loose.<br /><br />The fabric itself is a super cute, stretchy spandex material.  It IS thinner than I expected.  We've had similar dresses that just have a better feel to them.  For the $15 spent, we're happy though."

4501,5,B009R09Z8W,1,love this hoodie love this hoodie. the arms are a bit long and baggy but thats just how it fits on me because of my stubby little arms. otherwise the fit is perfect.
4502,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars it seems to fit ok .had to cut neck piece because it was way to tight around neck
4503,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Looks good. Fits well. Mid weight Athletic fit. Some reviews said that the arms were big but i did not find this to be true.
4504,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Order 1 size up. At 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 115 lbs I usually wear a small but ordered medium after reading reviews & medium was a perfect fit. Nice colors. Really nice base when layering.
4505,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect Green Hoodie! I‚Äôve never owned any apparel from Russel Athletic so I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. When the hoodie arrived it was the perfect shade of green! You‚Äôd be surprised at how difficult it is to find a plain dark green hoodie! The color, size, and fit were all absolutely perfect! It‚Äôs heavy enough to keep you warm, but not so heavy that your torso will be drenched in sweat after 10 minutes! I would definitely recommend this hoodie to others!"
4506,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great color and fit. I love the color and fit. Fit is appropriate for size. I ordered a medium. I am about 5'7"" and weigh between 125-130."

4508,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Superior sweatshirts! They fit nice and feel like they are of good quality. They outlast regular sweatshirts and are worth the money. My favorite. Thanks.
4509,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Great fit. I usually wear a medium and the medium fits perfectly. Great to wear over a bathing suit when on vacation.
4510,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Great sexy dress Very comfortable and sexy! Wife did as others suggested and shifted the tie to the back. loved it! üòâ
4511,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great tank but not compression I got a large because I have a big chest (36 DD) and these look and feel great. I'm 5'7"" and they came to my hips. It was a little loose around my waist. My waist is 28 and hips are 39. I love them but they aren't compression."
4512,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Buenas Muy buenas
4513,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars I like them fit me good!
4514,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfect tank! Fits great, well constructed, nice colors. Not in love with the large branding on the back but worth it. I got size M and I'm 6'2"" #190. Perfect for gym, running, spin class... walking around.<br />Would buy again."
4515,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,These hold their shape and are comfortable. I bought these since cotton A-shirts tend to stretch over time. These hold their shape and are comfortable.
4516,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"loved it. Fits perfectly, loved it."
4517,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Love the color a little big Love the bright colors buts a little big
4518,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars It's a little baggy for a small but i like it.
4519,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great fit It was perfect fit for my 15 year old grandson who is 6‚Äô3‚Äù
4520,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Muy rapido el envi√≥. Todo bien gracias.
4521,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Size content, smooth fabric,comfy I'd order more of these.  They fit as expected, the fabric feels cool and they're comfortable.  I'd recommend."
4522,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great sweatshirt. Holds up well and doesn‚Äôt ride up on your back.
4523,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,They are ok They are a little see through I wouldn‚Äôt wear any bright underwear with them. I am short so they do come above my belly button. I usually wear a medium and the smalls where little tight.
4524,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfort fit Colors are as pictured<br />Good comfort fit
4525,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great compressions undershirts I am 5'11"" 350 and I ordered the 2X size.  The shirt holds me and and all my extra bits in while allowing for normal movement and unstrained breathing.  I have ordered a few more packs of these and have gotten rid of all of my cotton ""wife beaters"".  For a secure fit that will not make you feel like an overstuffed cannoli  you will not go wrong with this product."
4526,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Excellent Good quality. Good price.
4527,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,They kept my tits in place I initially purchased to use just to wear under my work shirts but after a 12 hour shift in the sun I didn't sweat through the material as much and it keeps my rolls in place while doing cardio
4528,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfortable and flattering The fabric is soft and it breathes well.
4529,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Warm Everyday ware.  Warm and functional.
4530,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Too big for the petite Loved the design and the material is nice for a cheaper dress. I am 5ft at 100lbs and I bought a small and it was too big And too long for me.
4531,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"but it is comfortable and fit me perfectly Its definitely not compressing anything as many others have said, but it is comfortable and fit me perfectly."
4532,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,FREAKING AMAZING Just do it. That‚Äôs all.
4533,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,the fit was great this gift was the best. I was so amazed at the quillity and price. I would buy this again for gifts.
4534,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Just right. I bought the largest size and it just fits.  Very comfortable!  Bought three in different colors.
4535,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Runs small Comfortable, but I don't own any other size L shirts and only a few size M's. I also have a short torso. These are size L and they fit me but I almost think size XL would look more flattering."
4536,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"TIGHT FITTING Beautiful colors but too form fitting for me. I returned. I ordered a 2x and I'm 5' 5"" and 190lbs."
4537,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"runs very large Very good quality but runs very large.  If you normally need an XL, get the large, even for layering."
4538,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Love it! Super cute! Ordered 3 more after I got the first one! Perfect for summer. Looks super cute with a Jean jacket too.
4539,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"VSG Approved I. Want. More! I absolutely love the style and the light weight feel to these. I need more in 3xl, so I can get more. I recently has gastric sleeve surgery and these help with having workout clothes and relaxing summer clothes. I‚Äôll even model for y‚Äôall!"
4540,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Decent If you are looking for something tight that can hold you down, I'd either get something else or size down because the material is thin. Great for working out if you don't want sweat to stick around but overall if you are looking for compression gear the material (although very nice) wouldn't hold you together if you know what I mean. I'm 5'6 and 230 lbs. I got a medium."
4541,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Plus my boobs look pretty good in them also Perfection.  They for so snuggly with just the right amount of compression.  Plus my boobs look pretty good in them also!!!
4542,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars so comfy and cute on
4543,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great Great
4544,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Fit and qualty great!  And the price!!!!!! Must get
4545,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love! Fit great and super cute! Will buy more!
4546,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"I love these tanks I love these tanks!  They are so flattering and comfortable, and they dry quickly.  They are not compression shirts but they aren't bulky either.  They hug your curves and fall at the hip. I am 5'4, 135 lbs (strong/thin), with a 34B.  I bought the medium and it fits perfectly.  I have 6 of these shirts. I would highly recommend."
4547,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice and comfortable Love these shirts for the gym. Comfortable.  Made of like basket ball jersey material
4548,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars colors are great and they fit very well.
4549,5,B09M6X79V9,1,.. I use these tank tops under other tanks and shirts... love them... only wish they came in white as a 3 pack set.
4550,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars For my son well
4551,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Very Comfortable Shirts at a Great Price! I love these shirts and I get compliments on them all the time. The material is very soft and smooth. They are prefect to wear under fleece, sweaters, or sweatshirts because they are so smooth and won't bunch. I wear these tops all over the place. They are great for travelling because they are so comfortable and don't wrinkle. They are very warm when used to layer.<br /><br />These shirts are not compression.<br />I, personally, did not want compression because I wear these for every-day use and not to workout in. The shirts are fitted and don't have much bulk. They do NOT 'ride-up' my stomach or torso when wearing which can happen to me with very tight, compression shirts.<br /><br />I bought two packages of these shirts for a total of 6 shirts. They are my winter go-to tops. I couldn't beat the price. The quality is very good and I love the sporty stitching. I found the sizing to be true and ordered my normal size."
4552,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Good for base layer After reading reviews, I decided to go a size up. They fit well, but I wore it as a base layer at a 5k. The shirt kept riding up. After that, I started wearing a cami underneath, and the shirt stays put. Good shirts for the price."
4553,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,A favorite of my husband's for comfort and wearability. My husband loves these and states they are very comfortable.  You can't go wrong with the Russell Athletic brand.  They fit true to size and don't shrink when washed.  We aren't able to find these locally so was happy to find them on Amazon.com and at a very reasonable price.
4554,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"LOVE Really great work out leggings. I am the type of person that never buys expensive brands.  I have definitely heard of gym shark leggings. In fact, my sister has some. We compared the material. It's practically the same. I will definitely be buying more!"
4555,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Cozy This shirt is warm and cozy on these cold Winter Days in Colorado.  I have bought several shirts, because they are comfortable."
4556,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great quality hoodie! I ordered this hoodie a few days ago because I wanted to have something cozy for when my room gets super cold. Turns out this hoodie was better than I expected at keeping me warm! It's great!

4564,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Good quality Good deal
4565,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great gym tank tops! Perfect fit. They enhance the look of your pecs and upper body overall, while running slightly loose on the bottom. Good material and for the price they‚Äôre just great. I‚Äôll be definitely getting another 3-pack soon!"
4566,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"The fabric is the softest rayon and the dresses are adorable and perfect for the extreme heat and humidity here ... I purchased thie LILBETTER dress in navy/white and red/white.  The fabric is the softest rayon and the dresses are adorable and perfect for the extreme heat and humidity  here in Charleston, SC.  My only drawback is that the dress is a little snug in the chest area.  Now I am quite top heavy and I have gained weight this summer, so I cannot fault the dresses.  I do advise that if you are top heavy and broad shouldered, just be mindful.  But I love the little dresses.<br /><br />If you don't like to iron also, these are dresses that must be ironed after being hand washed, but the ironing is worth it because the dresses are crisp and cool for the summer."
4567,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love!!! Literally love these!!! So comfortable and the material is amazing!
4568,5,B09M6X79V9,1,i would recommend love these - i wear them in place of bras (got tired of the indentations in my shoulders)

Actually ordered it for my teenage daughter but it was too big so kept it for myself and ordered the Xtra small - still too big for her. But I have noticed I get quite hot wearing it so I‚Äôll have to find an alternative during summer.
4591,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Good deal Love them - fits true to size
4592,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,I like this material cause u don't get the fuzz balls all over the sweater if u lay down on ur bed. The material and the sleeves shrink back too size which is very important too me

4598,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Cute dress I would like to say Cute dress I would like to say!! Very fresh, and light fabric, love the polk a dots print ...great for the Florida weather. I‚Äôm not giving a 5 stars because the dress is a little tight in the chest part and I‚Äôm not feeling like exchanging it for a medium size, because I would swim in the dress. For the price of the dress I can‚Äôt say anything else!! I‚Äôm regularly a size 6, 140 lbs, 5‚Äô6."
4599,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits perfectly Exactly what I ordered
4600,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Comfy and durable I love these! They are soft and comfy, fit is great. Im 5'5 and 140lbs and got the medium and it fits really well. The material seems very durable and well made. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they are just a tad short on my legs and I'm not tall, so be aware if your taller these will be above your ankles. But not a huge deal to me, I love the fit"

4604,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Couldn't be happier with this dress! An absolutely adorable dress! My daughter (who is almost 7) gets compliments all the time. They are stretchy so they should last for a long time, despite her growing body. I ordered a size 8/9 to give her time to wear it and it fits very true to size as it is a bit long on her due to her normally being a 7/8. They are comfortable to play in, and seem somewhat durable. I am so pleased with these dresses that we've bought three different versions of it-and all are super cute!"
4605,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfect , will be ordering again once these wear out I play volleyball and lot of other indoor sports - It‚Äôs fits well looks good too. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and 190lbs I ordered size M.Quality is good"

4608,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Good buy, excellent true colors, great fabric Fits well, true to size if you use the chart. Tight right now, but that‚Äôs because I really wanted the motivation to lose and look forward to wearing them throughout my journey."
4609,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Exacting what I was looking for and fits perfectly. I was tired of finding hoodies with out zippers.  This is what I've been looking for a long time and made my husband very happy.
4610,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Husband Loves Russell This fleece not only is super comfortable and soft, it looks great on my husband. We have purchased other Russell men's shirts and have never been disappointed with the quality. It is better than expected."

Will be buying more for sure.  No need to give your hard earned money away for more recognizable branding, there is nothing inferior about these."
4617,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Love these sweatshirts! Bought one for me and loved it so much, I bought everyone in my family one."
4618,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Swag Great quality, comfortable and it looks good. Put it on and you'll automatically feel like you've just obtained superpowers you've never even imagined before. Not lame shit like super strength or super speed but like crazy kinda super powers you can't imagine. But, beware of the attention you might receive because it also acts as a visual aphrodisiac for people of any genders, this hoodie does not discriminate. It will love you and stay with you till you're old and crusty, not like the people you hangout with and call your &#34;friends&#34;.  But on the reals it's actually a really good hoodie for the amount of money you're paying for this product."
4619,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good I loved it‚Äôs perfect
4620,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars Very beautiful! And not too fancy.

4622,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars Perfect just what my daughter wanted
4623,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Beware of the size you order Just a warning for anybody ordering this. If you want a more fitted fit order a size smaller. I ordered a medium and it look a bit oversized. Ended up give the sweatshirt to my dad.

4628,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great bargain For the low price of approximately $6 each, these tank tops are amazing. I bought a size small, and they are not compression on me, but fit nicely--perfect for running or just wearing. To get a compression fit, I would size down. The quality is good--still amazed at the low cost--and the colors are bright. I'm used to playing rediculous Nike prices for the same thing, so I'm very pleased with my purchase. I'm 5 '2&#34; and weigh just under 110 for comparison."
4629,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Love it Good quality material.  Arrived before time which is a plus
4630,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good buy Great product
4631,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"which is what I would recommend if you have a similar body to me Torso portion of the shirt fit perfectly (I'm around 5 ft 8 in/173 cm). The sleeve length is a little bit too large. The sleeve circumference (if that makes any sense) was really big. I currently weight around 195 lb/88.45 kg (and still losing weight rapidly). Size large shirts fit me well, and I got a medium here, which is what I would recommend if you have a similar body to me."
4632,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Try these pants out. They are wonderful Very comfy and warm. Perfect length. Buying in other colors cause they are that good
4633,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Great workout tanks Great workout tanks.. only gripe is that the scoop neck is a little too high but other than that it‚Äôs great!
4634,5,B0B16Q1854,1,They are worth.it you can were as jogging  pants or pajamas I loved them so much I ordered  another pair they are so comfortable

4636,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"AWESOME! These pants are amazing! I am 5' 4"" 135 pounds and got the medium (I usually get a small but read a review that they run small). This is correct, the medium fits more like a small. However, these pants are so amazing for the price that I will be ordering many more!"
4637,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Lindo pero... Esta lindo muy buena calidad pero deberian hacer talla xs porque small es muy grande asi que si eres medium pidelo small
4638,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Good purchase Bought these to wear under my scrubs and I like them. Not to loose, but not to constricting."
4639,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love the leggings The fit is good

4646,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Nice quality sweatshirt I needed this sweatshirt for a Halloween costume that I was constructing.  It was really nice quality and worked out perfectly.  The chocolate is a true chocolate color.  I ordered an XL because I needed a oversized fit for the costume.  It worked great.
4647,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great hoodie! Great quality!
4648,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Great tank Great tank love the color blue it is and it hasn't shrunk at all either which is good. I would def recommend get it!

4654,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Comfortable pretty dress Pretty pattern, comfortable, nice cool material! I wear this over a tee! Have gotten compliments! Appears well made, love that it has adjustable shoulder straps and pockets! I‚Äôm 5/3 1/2, 150 lbs, 67 y/o, I don‚Äôt feel that this is too young for me! Ordered the XL, I don‚Äôt like my clothes clingy, so a L probably would have fit! I got the pretty red and black flowers with some green and white in the pattern! Great price!"
4655,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great tops I love them. I ordered large even though I wear medium, they are perfect, just a little itchy."
4656,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,What I've always wanted Its a nice soft hoodie.
4657,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Amazing product Amazing product, feels great when working out and fits great."
4658,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Gymshark Vital Seamless Dupe These leggings are AMAZING. I am a huge gymshark fan, and these are very comparable to the vital seamless. They material is slightly thinner, but they‚Äôre a great dupe, especially for the price! I will for sure be buying more colors."
4659,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice and thick Nice and thick. Warm.
4660,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great fit üòÅ They're really comfortable soft material great for exercise
4661,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great deal and fit I am so glad I purchased these . They feel great and fit great. I ordered the size that I always do which is a med . True to size.
4662,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Nice product Nice product
4663,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Great twirly dress. Perfect for a little princess. Great material and great fit. I got the 4/5 for my 5 year old granddaughter. She was soooo excited. It twirls, which if you have a five year old princess, you would understand the importance of a twirly dress!"
4664,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love this! LOVE this - it's comfy rayon and the style is flattering on a figure where you want to hide your flaws. The only con is I think the size is great but it runs a tad tight in the bust. On me it's tight enough that I won't be wearing a bra which is okay becuase I bought this for lounging or just running to the grocery, etc. I ordered the extra large and I wear a size 16-18 if that helps. Again, the only place to be concerned is the chest. It comes folded and wrinkled but it steams out beautifully. Again, this is my favorite fabric. I always buy skirts or anything made of this type of rayon. It hangs beautifully on the body."
4665,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good product Self
4666,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great for the price Can‚Äôt go wrong. Decent/good quality, gymshark fit, + comfortable. I got XS (usually S or XS, but based on reviews I sized down and they fit perfect, if not a little loose around the waist so if you have a smaller waist size down bc the butt and thigh area is stretchy!)"
4667,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars BEAUTIFUL... Fits great! Ordered an 8-9 for my 9 year old almost 10 she is tall and skinny!
4668,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,These fit great These are perfect.  I want to get another pair.
4669,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Four Stars Good fit!
4670,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Nice athletic tops! These are nice tops to wear with your vests while walking, etc. I read the reviews and ordered XL...I usually wear a Large (US12)  Only problem they were very long in the body so had to shorten them."
4671,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Good quality but they run small. For me the quality is good, but they run small."
4672,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Just buy them These leggings are absolutely perfect. They are not only flattering but also provide the compression I want for my workouts. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9/170 lbs and the large fit perfectly. They are squat proof and super comfy. The only small disappointment was the moisture-wicking. It does show sweat slightly. But that doesn‚Äôt really bother me. Customer service seems great. They really stand behind their leggings. I will 100% be ordering these in more colors!
4673,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"very comfortable. Fits well, very comfortable."
4674,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Snug fit but good for working out! I am 5'3, 125#...small is snug but perfect for workouts!"
4675,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great tanks These fit perfect. Look great. Wore one to go rafting today. Basically if I‚Äôm off work I‚Äôm wearing one. So comfortable.
4676,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great comfort and fit for the price! These are the best non-name branded joggers I have purchased. They fit true to size, extremely comfortable and wash well. They are great for casual wear (working remote, running errands, etc.) I have not worn them to workout nor was that my intent when purchasing them. They are not heavy, so if you are looking for something warm these would not be a good fit."
4677,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars Nice, as expected."
4678,4,B076QD9NP1,1,"Cute and comfy Purchased for my daughter--cute prints, easy to wear for play or semi special occasion."
4679,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Four Stars Good shirts and the price!
4680,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits great. Finally a sweatshirt ordered from Amazon that fits the way it should. 44 chest-ordered XL<br />Plenty of room in the arms and perfect length. Elastic waist-a rarity these days.<br />No complaints.
4681,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Exactly as pictured I bought this dress to wear at an all inclusive...it's exactly as pictured. It was a bit tight across the bust but other than than that it's perfect.
4682,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Worth the money These are so worth the money spent! They are stretchy and very comfortable! I love the pockets and how thick they are! I bought them in two different colors and I will be buying more!
4683,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Love Ordered several these are my fav
4684,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Material is thin Nice casual or can be dress up
4685,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great undershirts The tank top run small, the biggest size is a XL but feel like a Large.<br />Great price for compression tanks and loved using them for work, the only bad thing about these tanks I would say is they have a annoying tag on the inner lining of that runs on the side of the tank that can be easily cut with scissors."
4686,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Good, comfortable hoodie Bought this for my 11 year old son in a men‚Äôs small. It fits him a little big, but he loves it! It‚Äôs washed well and stayed soft. Great hoodie for the price!"
4687,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"I like the black the best - follow the size chart As other reviewers have stated the black ones seem to be a better, thicker material.  I wear these as an undershirt and they work well.  Follow the size chart.  I'm 5'11""  220 pounds, 45 inch chest measured per  instructions in the size chart and usually wear size 36 pants.  I lift weights for strength, I'm not a body builder, I normally wear a XL shirt  and the XXl fit great. If you have a small waist you can probably get a way with your normal size or even downsizing, but that won't work for this old bear.  I like these so well I ordered again in all black this time."
4688,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Cute style, mediocre quality, run small For the price I paid, I‚Äôm very happy with these. The fabric is a cheap somewhat rough cotton material, and I‚Äôm guessing It‚Äôs going to pill pretty easily. But again, for the price they‚Äôre as expected. I normally wear size large in all sweatpants, and bought these in XL. I think large would have fit, but very snug. I prefer my sweatpants loose, and the Xl is perfect. My favorite part is that they aren‚Äôt high waisted! I only like low rise or mid rise pants, so I was thrilled to find these! I‚Äôll probably buy another pair just because I think they‚Äôre flattering"
4689,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Fit great
4690,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love! I‚Äôm ordering another! Love this dress! Cool, comfy, and tons of compliments."
4691,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Looks great with workout pants Like the fit and it keeps you warm and is attractive

4699,5,B07XD71F1H,1,I love the dress Nothing
4700,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great gym shirts I like the light weight breathable material. It also soaks up the sweat good while I'm lifting in the gym.  Great gym shirts at a reasonable price.
4701,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Must have! Love these pants. Super comfortable. I‚Äôve bought several pair. Material is legging material but a slightly looser fit.
4702,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great shirts not yellow Hate the yellow throw it in the trash.it was to tight
4703,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Quality product affordable price Runs large will buy a pack that‚Äôs one size smaller other than that this is excellent value and excellent buy
4704,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Perfect Good Quality....
4705,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great buy! I wear these tanks under my scrubs at work. I stay on my feet and run around all day, so I needed something that didn‚Äôt make me more hot than I already am at work. These shirts are fantastic! I tuck them into my pants and they don‚Äôt come out at all. I‚Äôm going to buy more now that I know they get the job done."
4706,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Cute Cute dress runs a little big

4710,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great Product Great Fit I have the hardest time finding clothes that fit. They're either too short or too tight around the chest.. But these fit perfect. I got a large, I'm 6'1 and 220 lbs. It's snug but not tight. The bottom is rounded to cover your junk and possible plumber crack. Definitely recommend."
4711,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Love the fit The shirts fit perfectly.  I have to wear long sleeve shirts to protect from the sun, it‚Äôs hard to find them.  I‚Äôm very happy with these shirts!"
4712,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great running shirt Comfortable and dries fast
4713,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great product Very comfortable fit was great
4714,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great fit! Love them!!! I'm 5'4&#34; 130 athletic build and they fit perfect. Not too tight, not too big. I can now do burpees without my shirt flying up. You do need a sports bar underneath. I've worn with just a sports bra as well as with sports bra and funny workout tank over."
4715,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice and soft Great product
4716,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love these pants! Super comfy!! I get asked all the time where I found these pants. I have 3 colors & wear them all the time.
4717,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Flowy yet flattering! I was nervous when reading reviews. I saw a lot of pictures where the seem is in the front and it looked really off with the dots. Mine has the seem but happened to line up pretty good so it doesn't really stand out. I feel like if you have a really large chest it could be tight fitting but mine fit just right! I'm 5'7"" 185lbs and I went with the large. It is super cute!"
4718,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Smooth, comfortable and attractive These fit like a charm and my butt looks amazing. I feel confident wearing these. They are smooth and very comfortable."

4720,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,so cumfy I bought this sweater for me and I love it..
4721,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"These shirts work very well for me. I like theses shirts to wear under my short sleeve tshirts. The tshirts have cap sleeves. I am an older lady and my upper arms have crepey skin. I usually wear longer sleeves, so these shirts serve the purpose."
4722,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Fun flowy dress Fits as expected. Length moderately dependant upon strap adjustment. Loose and flowy. Polka dots are more bold and noticable than depicted.
4723,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Great fit Love the fit but the white was a little see through.
4724,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Quality Russell makes a great hoodie. I have both pullover and zip hoodies from them, and their quality blows the others out of water. Yep, they're expensive, but I won't buy another brand for my hoodies. I will have to buy more, since my wife keeps stealing them. Apparently, she likes the Russell hoodies better, too."
4725,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Beautiful, soft and comfy!! What else can you ask for!!! These joggers are awesome for the price. Ordered 1 pair and loved them so much, I ordered 2 more. My daughter also loved mine so much, she ordered a couple pair for herself!!!"

4728,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Good value for a cute, summer casual dress. Good value for the price. It is exactly as it looks on my screen (nice, dark red with white polka-dots) but the seams ARE in the front, which accentuates the fact that the pattern doesn't quite match up. Meh, whatever.<br />Like the other (blue) dress I reviewed, I'd wear this at a beach resort / pool party / lunch on a patio sort of places, but not a dressy restaurant.<br />I'm 5'9 and 180lbs; usually wear sizes 12-14. This dress doesn't go to the floor - its exactly as the picture reflects - but I find it a little large in the chest area (I wear 38DD)."
4729,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Beautiful fabric, elegant cut! Beautiful summer dress, the fabric is soft but not clingy! The color of the embroidery like patch is not as bright as in the picture but I love the simple yet elegant fit.  I plan to buy it in another color! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 160lbs, the large size is a little roomy for me but I like it."
4730,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great dress I ordered a size up because I didn‚Äôt want it to be clingy to my butt and stomach.  I‚Äôm glad I did!!  I normally wear medium and I ordered large.  It was perfect!!  The colors are great and the material is rather thick for winter.  I like it so much I‚Äôm planning to order a couple more!
4731,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good length. A lot of sweatshirts now days are very long. We are senior citizens and I was searching for a sweatshirt for my husband that didn‚Äôt come to his knees. This was a great sweatshirt of great quality
4732,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great if you have a small chest I'm too flat-chested for bras, and these work amazing to keep the girls in line!"
4733,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Prompt shipping Material is perfect for under scrubs
4734,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Comfy soft stretchy support pants Wow so shocker this material is amazing super soft and stretchy
4735,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Worth the buy! I bought them to wear under my scrubs. It‚Äôs great at moisture wicking and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm going to suffocate when I get too hot. These shirts are very lightweight but have strong seams with a serger type stitching. I‚Äôm planning to buy more once I see how they hold up after a month of wear.
4736,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great product Definitely pleased with the purchase
4737,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Comfortable pants kind of low rise. These pants are comfortable and easy to wear, but they do ride a little low. Other than that they are good."

4744,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great Value I ordered 4 more 3 packs after getting the first. These are a great value at about $9 each and exactly what I was looking for: a dri fit sleeveless shirt with a hood. Fit is slightly large at the waist so you may want to size down if you‚Äôre between sizes or if you prefer a tighter fit. Also, these are cut pretty long and the L or XL probably wouldn‚Äôt work for someone under 5‚Äô8."
4745,4,B0B16Q1854,1,They are very soft. And comfortable. But order size up I sent theses back when I sent the other3 pair just like them. And AmazonStoreCard has charge me for them . Said they didn‚Äôt get them.!!!!!

4784,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Love them! These are perfect for the cold. The fabric is so comfortable and perfect to dress by layers. I got the black/ gray/ coffee brown and the colors are awesome. The only con is that the stitching on the neck looks kinda cheap but nothing mayor. I would recommend 100%.

I love the fit of this dress. It's roomy and flowy yet flattering. I particularly like that the fabric doesn't cling and that it's super breathable and light. I wore it again and again on my Mexico vacation and felt super cute. I'm 5' 9"" and my measurements are 42/35/42 and the XL fit just right. I have a large bust (36DDD) and I wore a black sports bra under it and it actually looked like it was supposed to be there. I wish they had it in solid colors in the polyester fabric (instead of the rayon/spandex) because I'd buy it in every color."

4816,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"So comfortable, right amount of compression These leggings are so comfortable! They are not quite as soft as my PINK ones with a similar style, but I love the waistband that provides enough compression for them to stay up without having to pull them up but still plenty of room to breathe which I really appreciate. Nice color, fit really well. Definitely squat proof. For reference, I'm 5'8 (and they are not too short on me, and I have really long legs so this is sometimes a problem) and about 130 lb, and I got the size small."

4832,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Just what he wanted Fit is perfect
4833,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"I should have ordered a small.  There is also puckering along the shoulder and neck openings. For the price, these are an excellent value. However, construction could be improved to eliminate the puckering around neck/arm holes. I have a trim athletic body, I like to show my muscles.  I'm 5' 8"" 170 lbs, and the medium is too large (unless you really want something loose fitting that drops to a little below the butt).  The colors and fabric are great.  Shipping was quick. Thx."
4834,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great workout top! Soft and comfortable fabric. I‚Äôm so happy with the purchase, I ended up getting multiple. Loose enough so it doesn‚Äôt cling to your body and it doesn‚Äôt ride up."

4845,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,a nice hoodie But sleeves a bit baggy
4846,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Watch the sizing! Boy, careful reading the reviews on sizing, I can't really believe the people who are taller and heavier than me are saying they are using small, xsmall and that sort of things. I'm 5ft 7in, and 160 and the large is what I need,in these tanks, I have large in the sleeveless hoodies, and they are snug. Maybe these people don't have a chest and only big butts and legs?"
4847,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Very nice fleece jacket! I initially bought it because I freeze at work, it‚Äôs always freezing there, my old sweater wasn‚Äôt enough warmth!"
4848,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Well Made Hoodie is well made.  Believe best fit would be for a slim person that is average or taller in height.  If short and carrying a little extra at mid-section, it'll pouch."
4849,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Looks great on plus size bodies! Love these shirts because they actually look flattering on plus size bodies!
4850,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Comfortable These are warm enough to wear outside while working but not too thick so you can still move freely
4851,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Everything as expected!!
4852,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,be sure to use the Neleus size chart. I ... be sure to use the Neleus size chart. I usually am a medium / large but the x-large in this product fits well.
4853,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Comfy! Loved everything about it!
4854,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Dri-Power Fleece Crews Are The Best I have worn Russell Athletic Sweatshirts<br />for years. The Dri-Power blend is so comfortable for exercising or around the house. The fit runs true to standard men's sizes. An outstanding sweatshirt which I<br />highly recommend.

4861,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Looks and feels good for the money Everyone was saying the sizes were too small so I ordered a size bigger than I otherwise would‚Äôve and it was too big. I then ordered my size and it fit fine. I like them.

4867,4,B076QD9NP1,1,See thru in the largest size We love this dress I bought it for my daughter but she did need to wear a tank top under it due to the fact that it was somewhat see thru but overall very cute
4868,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Begins to ""pill"" with wear I love this and wear it all the time. The only issue is that it has begun to &#34;pill&#34; with wear. I have similar ones which I bought in the late 1980's which have never pilled at all. Oh well. Very warm, very convenient for carrying the camera when out with the dogs."

4878,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good workout shirt Good workout shirt, but I probably should have gone with a large vs medium.  My waist is small, so I thought that with the open arms it would have no problem fitting.  But it comes up a little high on the lats and is tight when I raise my arms, so don't order too small."
4879,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,That my son likes them for Christmas. There just fine.

4893,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Buy em When I took them out of the bag I thought they looked TINY. Despite that I tried them on and was amazed that they are a little bit compression and in all the right places. I recommend this product big time. As a girl who buys gym shark, this product is better and more squat and run proof! These suckers stay put"
4894,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great shirts I‚Äôm glad I read reviews on this. They run a little small so I ordered a medium instead of a small and they fit great.
4895,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,LOVE This are so wonderful regularly and going up a size has worked so well as maternity pants. Seriously so smooth and sits well on my growing belly.

4905,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Beautiful, quality and comfy! I've had this on my wish list for 6mo. Well worth the wait! Goergous colors, soft and comfy, no wrinkles. Well made, quality fabric. Compliments everytime I wear it. Can be worn alone or with leggings. I have to check color options because I will buy more! Only small note...chart said I should order XL but the the armeye/shoulder seam hangs 3/4"" off my shoulder and the cuff ends at the top of my thumb/middle of fingers. I wanted to wear it so much I didn't ask want to wait on an exchange. Plus I'm a Costume Designer so I'll make some alterations on this one and order a L on the next. Highly recommend!"
4906,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,It's soft and comfortable and looks great I wear this hoodie literally every day. It's soft and comfortable and looks great!!
4907,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Super comfortable and not see through! I got the black leggings and they‚Äôre great. They‚Äôre squat proof and super comfortable. Very stretchy.
4908,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Really good product These tee shirts fit just as expected, they are nice and snug, don't get overly hot and the seams are not irritating or rough."
4909,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Was worried but I love it! I‚Äôm short and maxi dresses are always hit or miss for me but I love this dress, fits great, loose and hits just above the ankles, plus POCKETS!"

4911,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Super cute! Arrived sooner than expected and fit like a glove. Very happy I went out on a limb and tried these. Also bought the matching long sleeve crop top.
4912,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Excelente para gimnasio Muy c√≥moda. Tela transpirable. Colores reales
4913,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Attractive Shirt I bought it and really liked it, however for me it fit too tight around the underarms and I had to return it. The colors were exactly as displayed and the fabric was really nice and overall design flattering.  I'd would have loved to keep it."
4914,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Four Stars I loved the dress the fit was fine.. but not as long as I would like ...

4916,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Great hoodie. Quality matieral. Going to order more!
4917,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"A staple for gym rats I ordered the large and XL as I'm usually right in between the two.  I kept the XL which fit perfectly (5'11"", 215, 40YO).  The high back didn't bother me at all and the back is wide enough to pass Planet Fitnesses' ""lunk"" attire.  Just a basic tank that you can beat up and throw in the wash without it shrinking or fading.  For $7 each, every guy who works out 3-4/week should pick these up."
4918,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great value A great value and comfortable too!
4919,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Breathable and I love the racer back. Very comfortable! I really love the look of these shirts. And they are very breathable. When I first put them on, they felt large. But after exercising, they felt just a bit small. I like them though and would buy more. They are also somewhat long. I may hem them up, but I think they are fine."
4920,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Yo uso talla S orden√© la S y ajusta perfectamente a mi cuerpo sin molestarme .. Uso uniforme traje y corbata (trabajo f√≠sico) levanto las manos, levanto objetos pesados extiendo las manos me doblo y me agacho a veces hasta 12 horas en un d√≠a o noche sin dejar de lucir bien.<br /><br />En el verano me ha mantenido seco y la camisa queda siempre en su sitio cuando giro me a agacho me paro o extiendo las manos hacia arriba ..."
4921,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,LOVE THESE Love love love these leggings!! I was gonna get some gym shark leggings because I‚Äôm tired of see through leggings that ride down. I got a medium and they fit perfect! Definitely gonna buy more! Don‚Äôt hesitate on these cuties if you‚Äôre looking for high quality seamless leggings.
4922,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,If you wanna lift more buy these today Since the purchase of these bad Larry‚Äôs I have seen a 10% increase in lean muscle mass. I went from throwing 225 like a little girl to benching 315 #feelingswole
4923,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Quality, good fit, feels good, looks good. Excellent fit (x-large, I'm 5'9"", 180).  Well constructed, seems likely to last.  Didn't shrink too much after laundering.  Just right for jogging in cool weather.  And looks good."
4924,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Recomendado 100% Tal cual se ve, me gusto"
4925,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Great Great, comfortable and durable"
4926,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love the fit and very comfortable Very easy to slip on and covers well
4927,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars great product
4928,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Amazing! LOVE LOVE LOVE these! So comfortable and fit great. I typically wear a medium so that is what I ordered, honestly I could have ordered the small and would have been fine. If you like the legs of your pants a little tighter, size down. But they do run true to size!"
4929,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Buying a second pair Comfortable. The right thickness. The right length. They directions say to wash with dark colors, they aren‚Äôt kidding! It will bleed the first few times you wash them. But that‚Äôs how fabric is dyed to get vibrant colors. It‚Äôs normal. Just do what the directions say and you‚Äôll be ok."
4930,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"If you are looking for an a-shirt but with better material, you want Fits as espected, snug and no flab.  If you are looking for an a-shirt but with better material, you want these"
4931,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Extremely happy The Russell Athletic Men's fleece sweatshirt was exactingly what I was looking for.  Fits perfect and is very comfortable.
4932,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Amazing workout shirts with nice, breathable fabric. I ordered these primarily as workout tops, and I am always wary buying clothing without trying on, but man, am I glad I ordered these. They are easily my favorite workout shirts now, and I can also throw them on for casual stuff around the house. I really enjoy the fit and cut. These tops are tapered a bit and the bottom cut is not straight; instead, it is cut in a way to accentuate athleticism. I really like it. The material is very nice and breathable. It remains to be seen how it hold up over multiple washes, but hey,you'repaying $27.xx for 3 shirts; you can't expect too much. I ordered black, but a guy at my gym was wearing the red one, and I liked it too. For sizing, I think these are pretty close to size. I am 5'6"" 145 with an athletic build and Small worked perfectly for me. I'll probably order another pack.<br /><br />In conclusion, these are really nice workout tops. They are athletic but not meathead douchey like some other stringer-type tops on Amazon."
4933,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,The material was Awesome Great Quality.
4934,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,I love it and have already worn it twice Fits true to size.  I love it and have already worn it twice.  I only wish there were more colors to select from so I could purchase more of them.
4935,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,As expected Fits like expected
4936,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,excellent quality  very minimal shrinkage I was really happy that this shirt didn't shrink up the back like all the ones I have gotten in the past. Of course they were all 100% cotton.  I like the hood better than the Champion I tried on and even though it's a little long that's way better than too short. Keeps me warmer!!
4937,5,B09M6X79V9,1,fit I'm 5.3 125 lbs. the small fits perfect. The fabric is nice. I love them so much I bought 2 more packs.
4938,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Grape, perfect color, perfect Fit ! I'm 5'2 1/2"" 117, athletic build, the Small fit perfect, purchased another immediately in the denim color. This top is  revealing on the sides and back so make sure to pick out a cute sports bra. Fabric is just the right thickness and soft, Love this tank top so much !"
4939,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Buy it, you will not be disappointed. This dress, is awesome, I love it, fits perfect. I‚Äôm about X-large, and this dress looks great on me."
4940,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Tight Fit Well sizing is a bit of an issue here.  I'm 5'7 and maintain a weight between 190 and 200lb. I purchased a large and it is snug.  The length is great but if you have a large chest and traps than it will be a tight fit. It is a little tighter than I wanted it to be but overall it's a great tank top.
4941,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Love this sweatshirt fit so well it‚Äôs up there for favorite brands
4942,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,ok warm
4943,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars This is a quality product that fits well.
4944,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Heavy sweat jacket These are substantial coats. Great quality
4945,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,product. Dey fit to help with sun. The product came as advertised. The fit is a little snug but that is to be expected. It works well keeping the sun rays off. I am pleased with the purchase.
4946,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fit perfectly Very happy
4947,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Good purchase Fabric nice.
4948,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Looks okay, but not the best fabric Ordered medium. Fits okay for me (5 ft 7 inch: 150lb). The logo in front and back looks neat. The should, upper chest and scapula is visible. Very similar to racer back design used in women's bra.<br /><br />But looks great if you have a wide should and muscular frame. If you don't already have a good V shaped physique don't bother spending money on it. The reason is fabric is not that great. This is more of a showcase your muscle type tanktops.<br /><br />It does wicks moisture but traps hell lot more inside. You can buy more comfortable cotton based gym T or tanktop from online /retail store. I would prefer a light cotton over this 6 out of 10 times."
4949,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Love Perfect fit!
4950,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Perfect fit. I‚Äôm usually a Large but I was iffy on the sizing since clothing from amazon can vary in sizing in my experience. But at 5‚Äô10 210 lbs the Large fits me perfect. Nice snug fit on my chest but it flows down and is loose at my stomach and waist.<br /><br />Material is comfy as well
4951,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Definitely worth the purchase I really do love these leggings. I had luluemon leggings that were gifted to me and when I went to purchase another pair they were $100....ummm NO haha<br />So It sent me on the adventure to find another pair of leggings that I loved that wouldn‚Äôt break the bank. I will start out with the one thing I wish was different: they don‚Äôt have a seam in the crotch area so when you start to workout the crotch starts to get a little weird. If you keep the crotch part of these leggings dropped a bit it helps. All right let‚Äôs get to the good stuff: they look amazing on, the color, the pattern that follows your rear end is on point. The fabric feels great and looks great on. When you sweat they don‚Äôt look like your sweating through them.  They are high waisted so if don‚Äôt like things hitting your stomach just keep that in mind. I personally feel like the high waisted leggings are great for getting your belly to sweat. I will Purchase again!"
4952,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice Sweatshirt What is not clear in descriptions of sweatshirts is how heavy they are. This one would be comfortable in 50-degree weather, but it is somewhat heavier than needed here in San Diego where winter weather tends to be in the 60-degree range."
4953,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Comfy Nice quality!
4954,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Es muy fresco y se ajusta a la talla Fue el extreno de navidad

4956,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love love love it Love love love it! I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô3 130 lbs, ordered a small. The dress came a little past my feet but I tied a small knot at the bottom to wear with sandals. This was my first time buying maxi dresses on amazon and I‚Äôm very happy with this one! Bought the navy color w floral design."
4957,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Even at large! Oversized!
4958,5,B076QD9NP1,1,So cute! This was better than expected. Nice light material for hot humid weather. Looks to be sized correctly. Can‚Äôt wait to give it to my granddaughter who is obsessed with kitty‚Äôs!
4959,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good quality! Great set of workout tank tops for men! Fits just as expected, mesh material so very breathable. Great to gift to any guy!"
4960,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell makes the best sweat suits... period. I LOVE Russell sweats.  Never wear anything else.
4961,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Swing dress Loved the dress but was too short for me. I am 5‚Äô3 170 lbs. Size large. Gave it to my daughter who could wear it on the short side. I I ordered the black flowered dress. It was sheer but she wore it with black tights and a long cardigan. It looked lovely and she said it was so comfortable.
4962,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"The price is good. Great colors , fit right very happy"

4964,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell Dri Power Crewneck Sweatshirt This sweatshirt fits as expected, size large, and is well made.  The price I paid for this sweatshirt made it a great deal."
4965,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Spandex compression shirts compress perfectly one size smaller than normally worn I bought some Tesla shirts like these but there were very difficult to get on and off. I purchased these compression shirts after reading the reviews. Some of the reviews said that their normal size was too loose, so I bought one size smaller than my normal size (medium instead of large - 5'9&#34; 215#'s). They fit perfectly and I think they will work well for undershirts while I am hiking this summer. I am also trying them out as a warming core layer under my regular clothes this winter. So far, I am very happy with them and may purchase more in the coming weeks."
4966,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Very nice Flattering

4972,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Warm and comfortable Really good fit and warm
4973,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Keep you warm These are great for wearing under scrubs if you're always cold. I definitely get warm in them. They don't breathe as well as I'd like but I'll definitely keep wearing them.
4974,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Very nice feel. The 2X large runs to small. It fits, but a bit to tight."
4975,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect Fit This one replaced an old one I had previously. Fit's perfectly.
4976,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Work great Work great!!!

4982,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute maxi dress Very cute summer dress for the price. If you need extra room at the top go up a size. I normally wear a LG on top but am reordering an XL.

4984,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Very Good Workout Shirts! Great workout shirts! I've now bought 6 of them, and they are most certainly my favorite workout shorts. They fit well and look very attractive when in the gym. They breath well and have a comfortable fabric. Definitely recommend. üòÅüëçüëç"
4985,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Joggers Love them - but the back is a little low. When I bend down I have to pull them up.
4986,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,It‚Äôs thin material. But looks very nice on. It was a bit lighter material then I expected. I can ware a long sleeve shirt under it  comfortably. So I decided to keep it. It will be nice in the spring and into the summer for a lighter cover up in the warmer temperatures.
4987,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Really nice sweater for the price Really nice sweater for the price. I ordered khaki but in the picture it was darker, more like coffee."
4988,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Its a sweatshirt..what do you expect? I have a nice Carthart sweatshirt...but it's black and everytime I go into a store in the mountainous area where I live, people look at me as if I'm going to put up the hood and rob them.  So I needed a different color...one that wasn't so intimidating."
4989,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,Super soft! Very comfortable and sexy if you wear nothing under it!
4990,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Shirts They fit just right and are comfortable
4991,5,B0B16Q1854,1,great fit I love the fact I don't trip over the length.  They are very soft and comfortable.  The more you wash them the more comfortable they become.
4992,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good value, good fit, and plenty of color options available I really liked the fit of these. They provide a loose comfortable fit without being too long and baggy. I now own multiple colors."
4993,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Nice Nice
4994,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Had for a YEAR and still look/feel Great! These are great for the price! They look and feel so similar to my gymshark pants. They are squat proof. I ordered a medium and at the time I weighed 139 lbs (about a year ago). I‚Äôm currently weighing 120 lbs and they are loose, but still fit! I love the color too. Just went on a hiking trip and wore these outdoors. They stood up to rock climbing as well!"
4995,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect fit. I love these and I want them in every color. They help hold you in and they are comfortable. My stomach is my problem area with my weight and these are not to tight and comfortable.
4996,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,New Hoodie This Russell garment is of unexpected quality. Steel zipper no less. I will look here for my next purchase. Thank you.
4997,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Dress is nice just need a little more room at the top
4998,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Cute fitting No wrinkles, fits well, slimed looking, great for work outs, or just laying around the house"
4999,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Super comfy Most comfortable pants ever!
5000,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great lounge dress I bought this to wear in the house, after reading reviews I bought an extra large because I am a 38D and it fits fine in the chest. I am 5'5"" tall 133 lb. It fits through the chest and is loose and comfortable everywhere else. I can wear it with flats or flip flops and it doesn't hit the floor. I love it and I might buy another one in another color!"
5001,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Lovely dress! Lovely dress! dress is cute and well made.  My grandchild is a tall girl  for her 4yrs and I followed the reviews regarding what size to get for her.  I got her a 4/5 and still room for growing.  No regrets on buying her this dress
5002,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Not as solid as you think! These leggings are flattering!! However I was expecting them to be a bit more solid and not so sheer. You will certainly need to wear similar color underwear. The company does ship the leggings with a sticker that says 60-75% coverage. Overall I am satisfied and would purchase another pair for leisure wear.
5003,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Excelente Muy buena tela
5004,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Cute but runs a bit tight Cute but runs a bit tight
5005,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"True to size Love these leggings. They are so much better than expected for the price. They fit just right. Not too tight but just tight enough for everything to feel secure and they don‚Äôt ride down. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 147 lbs and the medium fit perfect. I‚Äôm shorter and these still went right above my ankle which I liked because usually for shorter people leggings get all bunched up at the bottom. You can still see sweat marks, but I don‚Äôt get self conscious about it because everyone sweats so who cares! Bought another pair in the darker blue color and will definitely be buying more!"
5006,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Four Stars The dress shipped quickly and fit as I expected.  The material is slightly sheer.
5007,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars It was really nice to find what I expected in a pull over hoodie......Excellent quality!!!!
5008,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product Perfect fit. Awesome shirt snug on top loose on bottom
5009,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"good to go Good product, fits well. Quite a few flyaway loss strings tho. Easily cleaned up, just a nuisance."
5010,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars I'm a fan of Russell Authletic sportswear and this shirt was just was everything I expected.
5011,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,great quality for the price sizes are actually legit.  and XXL is very large and long in the sleeves and body
5012,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Third time was the charm I am 5ft 11 with a 48 inch chest. I weigh 225lbs. Either I'm not as fat as I thought I was or the size chart is waaaaay off, but after ordering 2XL which was way too big and then sending it back, then XL which was too big and then sending it back before finally trying L which actually fits I'm happy enough with the product."
5013,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,They are great for the price Staying cool and dry at the gym.
5014,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,My husband loves this jacket ! Bought for my husband. He likes to wear clothes that are a tad baggy on him its a perfect fit ! He loves it ! Very comfortable. Keeps you very warm. Great material. Color was as shown. 6
5015,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"good fit fits nice, thin but comfortable"
5016,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,I love the fit and how warm it keeps me! It fits wonderful and helps keep me warm
5017,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good a comfortable It is really comforting when it is a lil warmer then the one i used to have and good pockets and that what i really needed and it held my phone and my earphones really good i do recommend buying this
5018,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great Exactly as described. Thick and soft. Great price
5019,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars great
5020,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect Love the pockets and adjustable straps! Love the material... flows nicely and not clingy . Very comfortable . Got medium
5021,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good lightweight sweatshirt for the price. Good lightweight sweatshirt for the price.
5022,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Very useful item for working out and the cold Glad I purchased this item for the gym.  Keeps my torso tight while working out.  Also it helps as an added layer in the fall/winter months as well.  Will be purchasing more of these as I use these to switch from traditional cotton undershirts during these colder months.
5023,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great affordable leggings! They're a little long on me as I am 5'1, but other than that I love them! and they are squat proof!!"
5024,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Cant beat the price for $21 a piece, these fit nicely and look good. Good array of colors to boot."
5025,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great for the gym! I'm a relatively stocky muscular guy and I ordered these in for the gym and I'm completely happy with them. They fit comfortably and with the racer back they don't constrict me while I'm lifting, the fabric keeps me comfortable, and I just like the way I look in these shirts.<br /><br />If I lost mine, I'd absolutely order them again."
5026,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,TRC Christmas Present
5027,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Four Stars Good quality product. Great for running.
5028,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Vital seamless leggings are very stretchy and squat proof I‚Äôm in between size s/m and I went with the medium on the vital seamless but it ended up being a little big for me. So I returned and got a small. I love the leggings so much. I want them in all the colors. They are also squat proof which is just perfect. The only down side I can think of is I wish they had a little bit more tummy control but I just personally like a tighter feeling legging. Highly recommend them!
5029,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Super cute but very snug I'm 5'6"" , 136 lbs and the medium was snug in the belly and butt.  Not terribly so, but enough that it made me appear larger.  I don't have a big chest, so that would help as well.  I think a large would too big in the top.  It was very cute though!"
5030,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Great Choice and buy overall. I liked the product, the fit is a little sung in the rear/bum area due to it a low ride cut. Otherwise the fit is good."
5031,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Top Notched Shirts For the price, these are excellent. Fit is very good and the material is fantastic. I will buy more soon."
5032,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Good fit IT was great fit. Very flattering just as expected
5033,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,So Comfortable. These pants are amazing. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and they hit at exactly the right spot on my ankle. I got both the large and the XL. I like the large because it is a more flattering slim fit while I still like the XL for the roomier lounging fit.
5034,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Good deal. Comfortable. I like that the length is not too short or super long on size m.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2<br />Colors are great. Washes well
5035,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not a tight fit The tops are very comfortable and i like that they're not low cut, perfect for what i needed."
5036,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Looks great! Looks good on.
5037,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Buy them! These are so comfortable. They‚Äôre high waisted, perfect length, and flattering."
5038,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Love I love it! Goes with lots of outfit and is very comfy
5039,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Wonderful I love it
5040,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Would buy again I'm a size 10/12, large was perfect."
5041,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Feels Good Great product, this is my fourth time ordering it. The first order was more than 2 years ago and they are still in good condition."
5042,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,I love it I love this dress it make me feel so comfortable on my vacation.
5043,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute dress Super cute dress.  A tad tight in my chest (36ddd) but other than that exactly what I was expecting.
5044,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Very flattering for thicker women Update review: seller was very generous and contacted me and shipped me a new pair of leggings the same ones that ripped previously thank you!<br /><br />This tights are super cute and very comfy and they fit great on my body but after a little over a month they ripped I was bending over and the lining in the crotch just ripped so sad I loved these tights
5045,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,fits good id take another haha
5046,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Soft and comfy Very comfortable and was surprised with the great quality. Was just looking for something warm and to layer, but these are so cute to put on with jeans and for cool night and for anything üòä very well fitted üëç"
5047,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Lovely shirt for my brother that fits well and looks good
5048,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cute Purchased for a trip to Cancun. Cute dress and perfect for beach. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù10, 36DD, medium build. Ordered a large and it fits great."
5049,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Amazing sweatshirts! Very versatile. I absolutely love this style of hoodie, so I purchased four in total. AMAZING product! I cycle through them during the week, and I adore how comfortable and stylish they are. Buying more soon!"
5050,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Straps are a little wide I liked the product but there was a flaw in one of the shirts. Straps a little wide but ok.
5051,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,good compression level able to wear all day comfortably
5052,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"A-MAZING These are hands down AMAZING.  Let me first start with the fit. I normally wear a Large in leggings and sweats, i read the reviews and decided they were pretty true to size and ordered my normal. I tried them on as soon as i got thwm and was very pleased. These are a mix between a legging and a sweatpant. Nice comfortable rhick waistband that does not roll over. Tighter fit around the butt, not too tight, but nice enough to give you a womenly shape while still wearing sweats. Legs are wider a bit baggier, not over baggie a comfortable baggie. i am also 5'10"" and they came to right above my ankle. I'd say they are 7/8 length. Weight is 170, if you are looking for something a little baggier i would size up. I want to try an XL next and see what i prefer. 2nd, Material. When i say this is amazing I MEAN IT! its amazing. So soft and buttery, just an amazing feeling. You probably think i am being dramatic, but i am not. The fabric is just great. You need to try these. Overall quality, i have worn thwm 6 times already in 3 weeks and they wash so nice i have hung dry everytime. don't really trust the high heat in my drayer. even low is hot. this doesn't mean they will shrink, i just haven't tried it. For this peice point i am very very happy with this product. i would highly recommend to anyone who wants to be comfy working from home, being a mom, running to the grocery store while still looking stylish."
5053,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Love Russell Sweatshirts. I've worn Russell sweatshirts for many years. Can't find them locally anymore because they've been replaced by fad sweatshirts of less quality.  I ordered one to assure the fit, and ordered three more- I live in these things."
5054,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell zip-up hooded sweatshirt is a good utility piece of athletic apparel It's hard to go wrong with Russell products and this zip-up hoodie is no different.  I actually bought one for myself and one for my wife, both in large.  My wife, although normally a medium size, likes the large size more for lounging around while watching TV.  I like the zip-up hoodie over a tee shirt when I take the dogs out for a walk at night as it keeps me warm enough without building up a lot of unnecessary heat and perspiration."
5055,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great joggers Very comfortable and really cute joggers.  Great price too!
5056,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice quality Had only cheaper ones in the past. Huge difference in the thickness and feel of these compared to say &#34;Wally World&#34;. Did not hesitate to buy a couple of more.
5057,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I like how it fits and breathes Love how it breathes
5058,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Me encanto ,queda bello un dise√±o muy lindo y comodo Es perfecto me encant√≥"
5059,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great buy My granddaughter lived this dress and it fit her well.
5060,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Nice fitting
5061,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Cute style Super cute jogger style. The fabric is sleek and soft like a yoga pant. There is no elastic seam in the front of the waistband, but there is one in back which doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm 130 lbs and 5 4‚Äô I got a small and they fit great."
5062,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Best buy in a long time The material is incredibly comfortable. They can be dressed up or dressed down. I love that I can lose weight or gain weight and they will fit because I'm a yoyo with my weight unfortunately due to primary lymphedema. Highly recommend. I'm 5'4"" and 223 lbs and got the XXL. 4"
5063,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,The best! These are my favorite joggers! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 220lbs and I ordered the xl and they fit great! I always receive compliments on them. I can dress them up for work or wear for a brisk walk. Totally recommend! Pockets are a bonus b
5064,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great dress I love the fit and style of this dress!
5065,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,In love! I prefer these over my adidas striped leggings! These make me feel so free and are definitely squat proof. They don‚Äôt dig in my sides yet stay up at all times unlike my other workout leggings. I also bought a pair of gym shark leggings and find myself wearing these more although they are both great. No regrets. :) also look good as new after washing a few times. Will be buying more colors.
5066,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Good Product.
5067,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"WARNING: You Will Become Addicted!! 100% in love with these leggings! I bought the indigo & the steel blue marle size Medium. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù 130lbs- thicker in the hips, butt, & legs & they fit great, not too tight but not too loose. I wanted to go with a small but was afraid they‚Äôd be too tight. I will say the mediums were very loose at the top however I am very petite in my waist- I just rolled them down a bit. I actually love these so much I just purchased the green pair in a medium also. I‚Äôm just afraid the small would be too tight. Amazing product & literally just like GymShark brand but for half the price- you cannot beat it!! Hoping they come out with more colors!! Love them!!!!!!!"
5068,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Nice Es co se describe. Y muy c√≥modo.
5069,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Soft Perfect like the align joggers
5070,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Big Guy Approved Everything fit Perfect. Just what i need as a BIG guy
5071,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great for work out It fits perfect and it‚Äôs super soft
5072,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fabulous My son absolutely loves these shirts.  First time to ever have tank style and is very happy with them.
5073,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars nice fit

5075,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfy Fit They are comfy and perfect fit. Love relaxing in them with a cup of coffee next to the fireplace.
5076,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Mi compra Me gust√≥ much√≠simo estoy feliz con Mi compra
5077,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Bright, soft and great sweatshirt It's a gift"
5078,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars nice heavy shirt - large fit is fine for the gym
5079,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Good shirt. First Jerzees shirt of this type I've had.  Can't find anything wrong with it, and I plan to order a couple more.  Body and sleeves long enough even though I'm a bit tall.  Good shirt."
5080,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect Looks and fits just as expected
5081,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Good price for a great shirt Nice color and thickness. Love it.
5082,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Nice fit It's very comfortable I will order more in the future
5083,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Feel great but arrived ripped I bought these for my wife and she Loved them when trying them on, however, they arrived with a little rip on the butt area. Will return them and hope for a better quality one since she really liked how they felt and looked.<br /><br />They replaced the defective pair with no issues and received quick once they found out about the problem."
5084,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Fits well and looks good. What more could one ask for?
5085,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Thanks Great products
5086,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Material isn't very soft. Good fit & cute design These fit good and are flattering to my figure but the material is not very soft so they aren't a super comfy pair of pants I would want to relax in. I wear them if I run an errand or go somewhere rather than just laying around in them. They fit pretty true to size but be careful in the dryer cuz mine shrunk a bit after just 1 wash. I really like the design and would buy another pair just cuz of the fit.
5087,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,I would purchase this product again! üëç
5088,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable and Well Made I bought this for my husband and he loves it. My husband is a contractor and needs something that is not too hot and not too binding while working. This is perfect. It is roomy, but not overly large, which allows for ample movement while working. It also provides a comfortable amount of warmth without overheating. The metal zipper is a plus because many zip-up hoodies have nylon zippers which tend to break easily. This is a comfortable and well constructed product.<br />FYI: My husband tends to wear XL T-shirts, but I got him a large in this and it fits great with room to move."
5089,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Cute dress! I bought this dress to use as a bathing suit coverup and it is just perfect!  It's lightweight, comfortable and very flattering.  I am usually between a medium and large, and the medium fits perfect.  I purchased the white animal print and it's very cute."
5090,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great seamless legging! I love these, my first pair of seamless leggings and they are definitely squat and sweat proof.  Quality is very good and hold you in all around. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 about 135 and the small fits perfect.  I will definitely purchase more."
5091,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"So soft inside and out.  Fit great Love these.  The price is excellent and the fit as well.  Love the feel, silky.  A must have at this price.  Even a few with all of the different colors"
5092,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Blue Is Royal, Not Navy I purchased this product instead of others because the blue shirt in the photo looked like it was Navy. The actual color is more Royal than Navy. The products themselves appear to be of good quality."
5093,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Lightweight I love how light and comfortable it is.  I am 5'4 @ 140 lbs and 36D chest, I purchased size medium and it fits perfectly."
5094,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Not compression but still nice tops I was looking for tank tops that I could wear to sleep in that would be tight and stretchy enough to keep my girls supported. I'm a 36DD and I hate those tanks with the built in bras so I was very excited to find these tops. I ordered the large size for bust size 35-39 inches. I measure 41 around my bust and these tops provide NO support for me. It was like wearing any fitted tank top which is pretty disappointing seeing as how these claim they're compression tops. I even bought a smaller size than I should have and they still didn't compress anything. I'm going to keep them because I'll use them for working out and they're comfortable and good quality. I'm not sure if I'm going to try the medium size. I'll update my review if I get the medium size and find those give me the results I'm looking for.
5095,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Comfortable Love how soft the material feels
5096,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,I'm 250lb and xxl fits perfectly.  Not tight. Fits very well. Classy looking.
5097,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great top Perfect for HIIT workouts lightweight and perfect moisture wicking
5098,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect! Love these! No complaints!
5099,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Would order different colors!!! Everything!!!
5100,5,B07XD71F1H,1,So comfortable. Great fit and so comfortable. I'm not a dress wearer so I put leggings underneath and still looked dressed up. So happy with purchase.
5101,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,T-shirts Lo que esperaba. Bonitas y funcionales.
5102,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Perfect under scrubs! 5‚Äô5‚Äù 133 lbs athletic/slim build size small<br />I love these compression shirts! I bought them to wear under my scrubs and they are so comfortable. I would in physical therapy so there are times were I‚Äôm moving around and sweating and others were in just standing around and cold. These keep me warmer than if I wasn‚Äôt wearing them (no duh) but breathable so I don‚Äôt get over heated when I‚Äôm sweating. They are also sweat absorbing and dry quickly. I also love that they seam doesn‚Äôt rub under the arm and they thought to go around the armpit area. Highly recommend.
5103,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Super comfy These pants are super comfy and for perfectly. Love the cut, style, and the color options. Where can I get more?!"
5104,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits good feels good This thing is perfect  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 165 fits great
5105,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great for runners I am a personal trainer who focuses on runners. In the summer I like to wear professional looking tanks that will keep me comfortable in the heat. This was a perfect buy. I will be buying more colors in the near future.<br /><br />6'2"" 210 runner, bought Large. Typically I wear Large-XL."
5106,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great value for the price Fit perfectly. I did go up a size. Pretty vibrant colors and prefect under off the shoulder tops and of course for working out.
5107,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Quality shirts Nice quality workout shirts that fit as expected with great stretch color and length...Would definitely purchase again!!!
5108,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"warm and comfortable Fits well, warm and comfortable"
5109,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Nice for the Price These pants came true to size, material is nice. I've washed a couple times and they did not shrink and still feel and fit nicely."
5110,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good purchase Fits as expected. Good material.
5111,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Good quality material, size up I'm usually an L, sized up to XL based on measurement guides, which fit alright. There was also a weird fold along the seam line on both sides, not sure if it's an isolated issue and/or will go away after a wash.<br />I'm returning it as it is not very flattering, but I guess it could be a body type thing."
5112,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Breezy Perfect on hot days.
5113,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Fits perfectly!
5114,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Light weight, flowy dress Love this dress. It‚Äôs the perfect summer, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch me‚Äù, dress. Long and light. The straps are adjustable which is nice. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 190 and ordered a L amd it‚Äôs plenty roomy."
5115,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Use size guide. The shirts do feel like they run small due to the fabric but you can kind of stretch it out to fit how you would like. They‚Äôre very nice, not super breathable I noticed. Overall good."
5116,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Best use for me is The colour and material is soft. Not Dri fit material. Best use for me is yoga
5117,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Purchase I was wondering if you could sell me 2 or 3 of the white Neleus Men's 3 Pack Dry Fit Y-Back Muscle Tank Top
5118,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Price Good
5119,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,So comfortable These are the most comfortable joggers that I own! You can‚Äôt even tell you have them on ! Really! I bought a second pair!
5120,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Really nice looks beautiful on me
5121,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Great price, great hoodie Got this for my daughter as a birthday gift. ...she lives in it!  Loves it...great hoodie and super soft.  Even the tie strings were tye dyed."
5122,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Getting all the colors! Great material! Doesn‚Äôt shrink When washed and fits perfectly!
5123,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Comfy and Flattering! I love these! They're perfectly stretchy, the rise is slightly above the belly button, and the wide, textured waistband stays put. When I tried them on, I immediately hung up the pants I had been wearing so I didn't have to take these off! They fit like a sock - but on your legs! I did think they'd be textured, but they're not. The dots are just a pattern on the material, but they're in very flattering places. Order one size down or your usual size - definitely do not size up! I usually wear a medium in leggings and someone told me these are really stretchy so I ordered a small. I'm glad I did! A medium would be too big. I'm 5'3"" / 140 if that helps. I highly recommend these!"
5124,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Love these shirts Love these shirts fit snug as i like

5128,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Very functional I love the cute details
5129,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfect for short girls like me! This is a great casual ""house dress"" that can be dressed up easily with a belt around at empire waist height. It's perfect for short girls like me because the hem in the front is quite a bit higher than the sides so you don't trip over the front of the skirt! Perfect for lounging at home or doing chores because it's also got pockets!!!"
5130,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fits good My husband likes wearing this t-shirt.  It fits him very good.  It is not baggy.
5131,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Xmas present Fit perfect fast delivery
5132,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Amazing Shirts Been lifting for 3+ years and finally decided to invest in some lifting shirts. Definitely one of the best purchases I made. Quality finish and great fit.
5133,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Perfect I bought these Bc I needed sweatpants but I‚Äôm short so nothing fits me. They are super comfy and fit me perfect and they have pockets too üòä for reference im 5,3 and I got a size small"
5134,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars feel just fantastic
5135,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Same as gymshark! I have gymshark leggings,, these are super similar. Love the high waist, squat proof, stretchy, great for a tummy tuck appearance!"
5136,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Different sizes Each shirt fit different one was too small and one perfect the other a bit big but comfortable. Last well
5137,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Summer dress I like the dress it's just a bit snug in the ribcage. I almost sent it back for a larger size but felt that would be too big. I'll make it work.
5138,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great hoodie Great product and very comfortable
5139,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Great undershirt! Better then those hanes
5140,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute So cute.  Great fabric
5141,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,All in One Legging I love the style and comfort of these leggings.  The fact that they are seamless is one less ‚Äúitch‚Äù to worry about.  They hug and move with your bodies moves.  They also wash and retain their shape.  I would recommend these to my friends!
5142,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Favorite!!! Love these leggings!
5143,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Like Like
5144,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great workout shirt These are so dang comfortbale.. definitely probably won't last long but they are such good value and will probably last a good 3-6 months depending on how often you wear them..
5145,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Must buy!! If you are looking for workout shirts, you need to buy these. I put the shirt on and I  immediately looked like a young Arnold Schwarzenegger. When I went to bench, my weight went up by 200% and I became the strongest guy in the gym."
5146,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Very nice dress Very comfortable and true to size, I am very happy with the dress"
5147,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Perfect fit, nice feel Fits wonderfully and is very soft. Head hole is just the right size. Material is medium weight and great!"
5148,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,Size up I wanted to like these but they fit more like leggings and I was looking for more of a jogger style. I would suggest sizing up and then they would probably work unless the waist would be too big.  Haven't tried it.  I just ended up returning. The material is light and feels nice.  The quality for the price point is great.
5149,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great pants. Love these pants. True to size. Love that they have picked. They are a little short but maybe thats how they are suppose to be, they come just above my ankle and I am roughly 5 6."
5150,4,B076QD9NP1,1,Cute summer dress for the price. These are cute for the price. I had bought one for each of my four granddaughters and we didn't use the biggest one. I re-ordered one size smaller than the smallest for the youngest. Definitely don't order up on this. It is big under the sleeves. Nice for summer!
5151,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love this Fits great and decent quality lightweight sweater
5152,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Adorable Alert!! This dress is adorable! Stretchy and very comfortable....my daughter loves it!
5153,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Square proof These legging are very flattering ! and squat proof . I got them in a color gray. Very stretchy ! The only thing is that they did roll down while I work out perhaps I have maybe size down .
5154,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great quality sweatshirts I'm 5'10, 195 pounds (muscular build) and ordered an XL and it fits perfect. Not to tight not too baggy. I primarily use these for the gym but could be used for other occasions."
5155,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Very comfortable Perfect yoga top- great fit, very comfortable.  I even use them as a undershirt when it chilly outside."
5156,4,B0928FSGGD,1,One shirt sized wrong I really like these shirts but one out of the three was marked M but was very small.  Did not return because the price was good.  Will give the smaller shirt to goodwill.
5157,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,This shirt makes them hard gains worth everything! After the gains and sweating I needed a shirt that can keep me cool and not way me down! This is perfect I even ordered more!
5158,5,B0928FSGGD,1,good value Excellent quality for a great price. I will be buying more.
5159,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfy Very comfortable and warm

5161,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect Fit Exactly what I was looking for! So comfortable
5162,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"It does shrink! First of all its a great sweater. The quality is good and seems durable so far. However, I washed and dried it for the first time and it shrank more than expected. Now I have a lot of sweaters and only the cheap ones have shrunk like this. So, expect shrinkage like cold water boys."
5163,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Xoxoxo Perfect
5164,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Sheer material Beautiful color and comfortably soft but sheer enough that it doesn‚Äôt work for my body type
5165,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great product: similar to Zyia joggers Fit true to size. They are super comfortable. The band is amazing and stays in place. Can dress up for work or wear for working out. These are similar to the peak joggers from Zyia.
5166,5,B076QD9NP1,1,The dress is beautiful! My granddaughter loved the dress.  The material is also nice.  Hangs nicely and feels great.
5167,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love! Love these joggers!! Bought in many and green. I didn‚Äôt love the green color so I returned those. Just ordered in charcoal. So comfortable but cute!

5171,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"great material and stitching Very comfortable.  Did not shrink or fade.  Well made.  Color a little light for a'burnt orange"" but not bad."
5172,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Love feel of the fabric I love th product in every but it is a bit too large for me. Should have gone for the x small.  Will be in touch with them for a possible exchange.
5173,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,great fit great buy.  was great to see and try on before paying for it
5174,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Comfortable and a little oversized

5176,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Light & comfortable. Decently made Soft, flowing, not see through.  Light & comfortable.  Decently made, especially for the price.  Doesn't wrinkle as easily as you would expect it to.  I highly recommend this dress!"
5177,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"I love these leggings. I've been trying to find a more reasonably priced alternative to my favorite lululemon aligns and these are awesome. The waistband is slimming, the material is comfortable, and they seem very well made. I wear a 6 in aligns and am usually a small in other leggings and the small in these fits perfectly. I'm 5'3 and they rest right below my ankles. I ordered the purple but I will definitely be ordering more colors in the near future."
5178,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great Great
5179,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Best tank tops ever! These tops are comfortable and form fitting. Perfect sizing! True to fit! Great material

5181,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars The price was reasonable and I love the color options that they had
5182,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Best workout shirts to have. Love the workout shirts.  Very comfortable but a nice fit.
5183,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Fits Very breathable love the texture.  Got a large.
5184,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,nice looking crew i bought this crewneck sweatshirt for my husband.  he looks great in it.  smooth transaction thru amazon as usual.  thank you.
5185,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Way too short, but so comfortable and practical you'll wear them anyway. I'm only 5'5"", so unless you're really short, don't plan on them being long enough.  The fabric is very stretchy, which is very comfortable.  But after months of wear, the elastic in the cuffs stretches so the cuff rides higher and higher on the leg.  Luckily that is reasonably fashionable.  Unluckily for me, I hate it, fashionable or not.  However,  I have yet to find a better alternative."
5186,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Great Fit, good quality"
5187,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"I am so happy I ordered this dress! This dress, Happy Sailed Women Halter Neck Boho Print Sleeveless Casual Mini Beachwear Dress Sundress, sold by Happy Sailed, is awesome! it is soft and stretchy.  I ordered small and the fit is perfect! Not too tight and not too loose. I'm 5'3"" and weigh 118. Love, Love, love it!"

5190,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Great dress Great dress. Wish it was a little thicker though
5191,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Soft, comfy, cute. Fits my tall frame and I'm pleased."
5192,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Neleus is great Size as described, feels nice, fits nice. They never disappoint"
5193,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"They are perfect for me and summer. I love them. I have 1 in every color. I wish you had white dresses with red dots, blue dots  and black dots. I will be first in line if you get them."
5194,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Super comfortable I ordered 2xl and have a 46"" chest and it fit really loose around the waist which I wanted that's why I went up a size. Shirts are very comfortable"
5195,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,A must have summer dress! I absolutely love this dress! U can dress it up w/jewelry and go out or throw it over a bathing suit and relax! I love the flow of the fabric and how light it is.  A summer must have!
5196,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Soft fabric This is well worth the money. I liked the softness of the fabric and I always love hidden side pockets.
5197,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Warm and comfortable Straight out of the box, this fit well and felt very comfortable especially on the inside. After washing, it still fit well but was less comfortable. Some of the softness of the inside material was lost but still fairly comfortable.<br /><br />The fit at the neck is the only issue. It is a little snug. I can see where some people with larger necks would have problems.<br /><br />This hoodie has no style so it is a plain vanilla hoodie. Not bad looking at all. It just gets no style points.<br /><br />This hoodie does provide ample warmth. It is thick enough to keep you warm without being too bulky."
5198,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Just kept anyways Bought smallest still to big but nice
5199,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Perfect for gym I work at my gym, and wear these shirts while working as well. These are great for the winter."

5204,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Five Stars Silky soft material & fits to size, my daughter loves it!"
5205,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Really like them a lot
5206,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Very flattering These are the most flattering leggings. I ordered many from Amazon and returned most until i bought these. I ordered 3 pairs now and will order more. I'm 5 3 athletic and weigh 133lbs. I ordered a small.
5207,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good Product Shirts were just what my wife wanted, fit perfect... Thank You"
5208,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"This product delivers! Very pleased with the quality of this hoody. The size was exactly as I expected and the thickness of the material is suprisingly good. I think it will keep me warm when needed, but it's light enough that you don't feel you're wearing a coat. It's not inexpensive, but it's also not cheaply made."
5209,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Get a size down for real compression. I love the way this looks.  I think I got a size too big for it to be compression.  I used it during my excercise class under a shirt and I got hotter than usual.  Not sure it was the top though.  More research to be done.  Loved the colors and the price.
5210,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice Sweatshirt Really like the sweatshirt.  Comfortable in weight.  Sized as expected.
5211,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Cute! This dress is super soft and comfortable. I got lots of compliments on it. It was cold out so I wore a long cardigan over the top of it and it was cute with black bootie shoes.
5212,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Quality Quality
5213,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Most comfortable pants ever I LOVE THESE PANTS. They are by far the comfiest pants that I own. Way better than leggings or yoga pants. They‚Äôre definitely a little more casual than I thought they would be, but I don‚Äôt even care! The materials is so smooth and stretchy, the pockets are big enough to hold my phone, and the waistband isn‚Äôt too tight. Will be buying more for sure!!"
5214,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Best to size down Quality jackets just ran baggy. Best to size down.
5215,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very Comfortable Very comfortable and fits well.
5216,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Pleasant surprise. I was a little bit skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised. The fabric quality was nice, and I really dig the branding that adds a bit of contrast but not cheesy or tacky like a lot of other brands out there.<br /><br />The fit is great. I am 6ft, 175lbs, chest 43‚Äù, waist 34‚Äù, and I ordered US size Medium. I like my clothes fit a bit more snug but this one is a perfect in between. Great fit around the chest, doesn‚Äôt slide around like a lot of other y-stringers on the market that require you to constantly adjust it. It‚Äôs just a couple inches bellow the belt/waist line, so if you like yours longer/looser, take it into consideration."
5217,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"love them The material is good quality, does not change with time or over washing it. An has a nice fit characteristics"

5221,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good fit and material Fit perfect, nice and light. And looks good"
5222,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Swearshirt It bothers me that the new small is a medium. I don't like that the sleeves are so long that I have to roll them up a bit. That being said, I really like the sweatshirt. It is very warm and excellent for cold days."
5223,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Four Stars Good. But I wish they were longer.
5224,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"My Step-Children's Mother loved it, the color look better in person than ... My Step-Children's Mother loved it, the color look better in person than on the computer, it is brighter. Does not shrink when you wash it in cold water."

5227,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Just right If you're looking for super tight, difficult to put on shirts for extreme slimming, these aren't those. But if you're looking for something that fits tight and well, not hard to deal with, and easy to care for, these are for you. I'm 5'10' 185 in shape and ordered the same size (M) that I buy for shirts and sweaters. Just right."
5228,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Short inseam These fit down on your hip than high on your waist.
5229,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great product They do come down a bit but they are great undershirts for me
5230,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great product It fits great! Keeps me warm but not excessively hot where I start to sweat. Tight fitting makes me look slimmer but very comfortable material . Definitely will order something similar for my husband

5232,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"The moisture wicking is great, fit is too snug. Love the colors. Do not like the fit."

5237,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Adequite and a Little Small It's a nice hoodie. It is too small to wear over anything thicker than a t-shirt.

5239,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Soft and well made Nice.  My son loves it.  Zipper is good.  Fabric is soft and wearable.  Stitching is good on this.  Won't come apart too soon.  Very washable.  Nice.

5245,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Love the material I‚Äôm very comfortable for workout Love the product will make good
5246,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great dress except seam up the front I really like this dress. The material is very flattering and not clingy. I just wish it didn't have a seam down the middle of the front! Why would someone design a garment this way?? Otherwise it's great and I wear it a lot.
5247,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"I like this dress I bought this dress hoping it would match some leggings I have but they didn't match. However, I like the dress and have even received lots of compliments. It is comfortable, too!"

5252,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Im 6'2 210lbs and XL fits great. Fits well. I ordered another set of 3 after the first.
5253,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"My new favorite exercise shirt (s) I love these shirts. I bought a large and it fit perfect. I am 5'10 215-220 depending on the day lol. I sweated the white one out and it still looked clean and fresh. The picture is from a post workout. It's a thin, dry fit like material. I have nothing bad to say about it especially for the price. Hopefully they won't tear easily. That would probably be my only concern because of how thin it is. Very pleased with it so far."
5254,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect Exactly what I needed
5255,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great casual dress I am only 5 feet tall and it was a little long.  The dress is a generous cut.  I ordered a large and it was just a tad lose at the top.  I ordered a medium and it was a little more snug at the through the chest than I like.  I wear a tank underneath so I can wear a bra.  Perfect for summer.
5256,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Five Stars Nice fit, the compression feels nice"

5261,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Tight shirts They‚Äôre simple beautiful
5262,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"SURPRISED! Legit high rise for my tall ladies/fellas! Ok, I am on board with the majority of folks who ordered these leggings. I was seriously surprised at how much I like these. At 5'9, high rise means something a little different to me as opposed to my 5'4 sisters and brothers out there, but these are legit high rise! I typically wear compression leggings--these are not compression leggings. They are very soft, but the waist on up feels secure and doesnt move around much which is a nice surprise.<br /><br />As with any pair of leggings, lighter colors are definitely going to show sweat in the crotch area, these are no exception. They are soft, legit high waisted, great colors, stay put for the most part and a great price. I havent washed them yet, so I may update this, but so far so good."
5263,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Big and Tall Fits perfect for my frame

5313,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great... but I really like these leggings and have bought two pairs but have noticed an issue since purchased. Both pairs have developed a run right in the middle of the crotch area. It is currently small but the second pair came with the run and the second pair I after seeing the run in the second pair and found a run in those as well.<br />I wonder if this is a coincidence, manufacture error or has to do with the types of workouts I‚Äôm doing (a lot of flexibility work).<br />The run is small right now, but I know it will get bigger as time goes on, which worries me. And for the second pair to arrive with a run is frustrating.<br />I still love these pants and will probably order another pair to see if they all have runs and make my judgement from there."
5314,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good Not best quality, but good for the money"
5315,5,B0B16Q1854,1,As expected. My last pairs I bought over 15 years ago & they‚Äôre just now wearing out with fabric wearing thin in the legs.  These have always been my fav go to hiking or lounging sweats.  I wear them a ton.  So excited to have new ones.  Here‚Äôs to another 15+ years.

5331,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"So dang comfy When I saw these online, I thought the color was gorgeous! Of course, I was more than satisfied when I opened the package. The color is more rich than expected. The material is thin but warm enough and so so comfy! The waist band is wide and the top hits right above my bellybutton. They aren‚Äôt super tight but still hug all the right spots and is flattering. Will definitely be ordering more from their collection.<br />For reference, I ordered an XS and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3"
5332,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Thick and warm Nice and thick and warm for working out outside when it's cold.  I use w no t-shirt underneath b/c I stay warmer that way when I sweat in the cold weather.  You can sweat in this hoodie and stay warm.  These hoodies do run big.  I am usually a 2XL on shirts, jackets, sweat shirts.  But I was swimming in the 2X.  Returned for XL and a bit snug but much better."
5333,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great fit Love these! Not tight like leggings but similar feel.
5334,5,B09M6X79V9,1,True to size and length is perfect. Tops fit perfectly. Long enough to show under blouse which is perfect. Great for the price.

5337,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great bargain Great product. I do wish I would have ordered an XL, only to get a little more length on the shirt. The fit around the waist is fantastic, as well as the shoulders, but it does feel a bit short. I ordered the large after having ordered the XL on the Neleus Tshirts, and I felt those were a bit too big. Maybe I'm just in-between. Would rather them be a bit short than feel like I'm swimming in it though."
5338,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product for Price These shirts are very thin I like that because I get hot easily. It feels like I‚Äôm wearing a bra though lol but for the price it‚Äôs a great buy.
5339,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,Good buy! This shirt is great for exposing a cute sports bra!
5340,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Great hoodie Love this hoodie. It fits wonderfully, the colors are vibrant and beautiful. It's so soft, too, and very warm. The only complaint I have is that the spiral in the front was sort of clumped and looked more like a dark blob, but that's ok. Would recommend!"
5341,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great sweaters Great fit. My son liked both colors, which was black and gray."
5342,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Joe's has awesome high quality stuff!! I have bought alot of clothes from Joe's and I love it all ! Good quality and super bright colors. Highly recommended
5343,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good to go! Perfect fit.  Love the vibrant color.  It's very comfortable.  I usually buy extra large t-shirts and sweats to allow for some shrinkage, but I read many reviews which said these sweatshirts run a little large.  So, I bought the large size and fits great.  With a 50/50 blend I don't expect it to shrink.  I'm good to go."
5344,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Lost for words Nothing to add
5345,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"good sweatshirt good sweatshirt. after reading the review, i ordered an xl (always have worn a 2x) glad i did-fits well (47&#34; chest, 37&#34; arms)."

5348,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great product! It is not easy to find compression tank tops for men who are big in a muscular way. These are awesome and reasonably priced too.  Highly recommend
5349,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,My favorite hoodie. Not to thick and not to thin.

5354,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Another Amazing Product from NELEUS! I will always write about NELEUS. These Tank Tops are amazing. I always use them for working out or anywhere I go. They feel amazing. They don‚Äôt scratch your body like other tank tops I‚Äôve had. They are smooth & stretchy. Very useful for working out. I‚Äôve bought several pairs. I was & will never be disappointed with their Tank Tops. Definitely a good choice for a Tank Top.
5355,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,awesome I got it to monogram and it fit a little big but it was a comfortable bigger fit. I love it.

5365,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great value and nice color choices Great set of shirts but they seem to run small [if your bra size is larger than C].
5366,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Very chic and comfortable Fit just right in the chest and it gets loose in the lower body.
5367,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great Training Tank Tops Love these tanks, they fit pretty much perfectly. Just order whatever size you would typically get. I wish they were just slightly longer and a little more tapered in the midsection for a more athletic fit. But other than that, my new favorite training tips.<br />The fabric is breathable and wicks away sweat, dries fast keeping you cool and not sticky during your training."
5368,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Arms were long enough! I chose this hoody because it looked like the arms are longer.  My son is tall, slender and with long arms.  I was very pleased that an extra large fits him perfectly. Long enough in the torso, long arms and not too wide. It fits him just like the picture.  Very happy."

I wear under another top to work out and have no issues.<br /><br />July-2  months later and several workouts +washes and the are still form fitting and in good shape. I workout 5 to 6 days per week with these.. ordering more!
5373,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Very nice, comfy, soft shirts! Needed a shirt to wear under my uniform. These are very form fitting and tight but stretchy and are very soft and comfortable. I usually wear a medium/ large and so glad I ordered the extra large. Very well made and just washed and they washed very well too.<br />Also I was running around sweating at work yesterday and the shirt actually was able to breathe and I never got wet from sweat. It just disappeared and did not smell or anything. Great shirts!"

5388,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good product Good quality!
5389,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Much better than expected! I wouldn't call this compression exactly but it definitely offers more support than your average cami. I'm very large busted and can't wear bras due to too much compression around my diaphragm so I was looking for a cami that would offer a little support so the girls don't just hang loose. This fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />I ordered a size smaller than I normally wear and I probably could have even gone one size below that. I bought small and they work perfectly for my needs. I haven't washed them yet so if they pill or shrink I'll update my review. So far I love them!<br /><br />Btw, I'm 5'5"", 122#, bust 34DDD, waist 27, hips 35 - the small works great!

5395,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love this dress! I have several of these in tank and short sleeve but this is my first long sleeve dress. It fits perfect and is not see through. Goes great with a pair of leggings!
5396,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Todo bien pero un poco corta de mangas Me agrad√≥ la tela, la calidad, la frescura, pero para ser talla ‚ÄúL‚Äù me qued√≥ corta de largo en las mangas. Todo lo dem√°s est√° bien üòâüëçüèº"
5397,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great for the beach and for working out! I love how it fits around the chest area. Only thing I would change is to be a little more snug around the waist.

5409,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Nice base layer I ordered these shirts to wear under my uniform at work. I work inside and outside my facility in all weather. I tend to sweat being layered up and this helps keep me dry and comfortable. I also a pair of compression leggings with the pocket. My uniform is big, poorly constructed for a woman's body and the material is rough. These shirts are pleasant against the skin and makes moving in my industrial work pants easier. I would definitely use these shirts to work out in... and hopefully that will be my next step. These shirts are well made and worth the price. I chose the XL - the arms are long but they make my girls look great even in a no wire bra! Definitely recommend."
5410,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"perfect for my purposes I'm 5'4, ~130 pounds, usually wear a 7 in pants and a small in shirts, and these were perfect for my purposes. They definitely aren't &#34;compression&#34; tanks, and the white one is definitely see through without a sports bra, but really what I wanted was a tank top I could wear over a sports bra, tight enough that it wouldn't make me look like a rectangle, but not too tight that I couldn't breathe comfortably. They met all those marks, so as far as I'm concerned, they're great."

5418,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Seems fine
5419,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I love the fit These shirts are THA BOMB!!!!!  I love working out in them.
5420,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweater perfect fit good quality. No issues
5421,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Good Good money sent
5422,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"A word on sizing It was hard to determine what size to buy, so I ended up going with my normal &#34;t-shirt&#34; size.  For me this ended up being too small.  I wasnt looking for active compression, but rather a snug next to skin fit.  So I re-ordered one size up from my t-shirt size and the fit is great.  So if you're looking for an undershirt that is actually squeezing compression, go with your t-shirt size, if not go one up.  I would definitely not recommend going a size down thinking it'll suck your gut in more.  Changes are it plain wouldnt fit."
5423,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Runs a little large on me and I wear 2xl short Runs a little large
5424,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable It's a little bit too big but will work
5425,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,good fits great very soft
5426,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"like a compression shift should I bought these to wear under my scrubs. I purchased the large size which fit well. I usually wear medium to large in shirts. They fit a little tighter, like a compression shift should, and allows my to wear my lab coat over my arms without it bunching up everywhere. My only complaint is that they are not that long, they tend to ride up during the day which is slightly annoying, but somewhat unavoidable with compression clothing."
5427,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,great! lightweight and great price!
5428,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Best 3 Pack in the market ! Perfect ! Defiantly recommend. Really comfy and breathable for workouts. Will buy more soon, just to see if they last long."

5431,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great fit. Great length. Great fit. Runs Slightly bigger but for me it‚Äôs more comfortable so it‚Äôs fine. They‚Äôre nice and long.

5433,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Most comfortable Perfect for slightly larger thighs

5437,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Works for Me Comfortable
5438,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"One shirt fits different Oddly, two of these tops (the two blue ones) have a stretchy quality to it in the arm/chest opening they fit great and even if you get a pump at the gym they stretch a little. But the green one, it has no stretch to it in the arm/chest opening and fits a little smaller than the other two.<br /><br />For the price, I guess it will work but it is a bit odd."
5439,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Love this dress. Perfect fit, looks amazing on, and great price."
5440,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Sizing I'm very pleased with my shirt, got here on time and fits just how I imagined. I wear an Xl but shopping online I normal order an xxl so not too tight, but I'm sure glad I went with my usual size. I would order again."
5441,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Really Cute and Oh-So-Comfy! Call me crazy--I actually got this to sleep in, cuz it's a lot less expensive than a nightgown and looked comfortable.  It worked perfectly, but it's so cute I can't wait to wear it out, too.  A perfect dress.  I think I'll head back and get another!<br />ps.  Bought my usual size, a Medium, and it""s true to size."
5442,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Flowy, Comfy, Light, Pretty, Versatile. Get it! Better than I expected. I quite enjoyed wearing this dress and that says a lot, bc i prefer comfort over being fancy. This dress is just right. You can dress it up or down. I recommend!"
5443,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Ordering more right now! After reading reviews I decided to order a small. I'm 5'5"", 28 waist and 38 hips/üçë. They fit perfectly. They come down to right above my ankles so they aren't too long. They are squat proof and stay in place. I got the charcoal grey marl, the color is just as pictured. Will be ordering more in other colors!"
5444,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,I love this sweatshirt I love this sweatshirt.  I bought it for my husband and he loves it too. The size I got was perfect. I will be ordering more for these for sure.
5445,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Wasn't as tight as I had hoped, but still pleased. All my shirts are medium, but I ordered a small for this compression shirt because I wanted to have even more of a compression feel, but it wasn't as tight as I had hoped for."
5446,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good workout tank Fits well and dries fast so you don‚Äôt feel too sweaty.
5447,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Would purchase again Great quality
5448,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Very cute dress Dress was very soft and comfortable. Length hit me right at the knees. I wore it with boots. The lace on the bottom dresses it up and I receive compliments on the dress whenever i wear it.<br />I bought a large. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 135 pounds. The dress is great and will buy another one.
5449,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product These shirts are of high quality material and fit superbly. Very breathable material.
5450,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Love it I normally buy 3x but I went with the 2x it‚Äôs a little snug but I‚Äôm not disappointed. I needed the smaller size. Buy it you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

Material is also stretchy and light weight without being flimsy. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase! I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 195 lbs, 36 DD chest and curvy hips and thighs. I purchased an XL and it‚Äôs perfect. Falls just above the knee on me."
5454,5,B0928FSGGD,1,X large The material is very good. I usually wear a large but I got an X-Large. The X-Large fits like a 2xl.
5455,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Super comfortable I love the compression, and also the softness of the fabric. Worn under scrubs for work. Would absolutely purchase again."
5456,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Great base layer These tank tops are very comfortable. I wish they were a little thicker & more form fitting. I wanted these to wear underneath my workout shirt so that when I do exercises over my head or floor exercises my stomach wouldn‚Äôt show. These shirts do not stay in place.
5457,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,The best Fits amazingly. Bought another. LOVE
5458,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Five Stars Fit perfectly. I bought another 3 pack after trying on the first pack i bought.
5459,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Outstanding I ordered these shirts for my daughter‚Äôs  that play high school softball they fit really well and look very nice.
5460,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Get 1 or 2 sizes up. Fits as expected.  GEttinger a XXL next time I buy. A tight fit is good but a loose fit when biking will cool me better.

5467,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great for weight lifting and hard workouts! Great fit, material is great to lapet the air through. The fit provides good range of motion without snagging all the time like other models. Light weight material, and dries quickly."
5468,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Would repurchase again. This is my second pair and color of high waist leggings from this seller. I repurchased because I love the fit. At first sight of the product in the packaging it seemed small but it stretches perfectly and is true to size.
5469,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great Tanks Exactly what I needed under clothing in summer. Love them!
5470,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Better than the rest of the ones I have I wear them inside out because of the tag. Don't even notice that I'm wearing one

5473,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Comfy Great for long legs. They're not too baggy or tight. I like the fit better than Victoria secret PINK sweat pants. The drawstring is thick also, so that it doesn't easily get lost inside the pants after washing."
5474,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Nice Softness
5475,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars The boys both loved these.
5476,5,B09M6X79V9,1,kept me cool love them
5477,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Definitely not shape wear They're not so much compression but they definitely work as undershirts or a shirt just to go under a button up or something like that very cute!
5478,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good for the price Fit well<br />Decent material<br />Good for the price
5479,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"You definitely need to go a size up. I‚Äôm small. I ordered mediums do i‚Äôm Glad I did. They‚Äôre perfect! The dri fit. Keep you cool/dry. However, sometimes they can be too hot on a warmer day."
5480,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Will buy more Used it for a few weeks and no issues

5483,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Great Price for product Finally got a dress I'm not having to return. So happy about that. I ordered the medium. I am 5' 8"" tall & 143 lbs. 38C. Fit's perfectly. Falls just above the knee. There's a extra room in the hip area because I have none but it still looks good. I like it so much I ordered a few others with similar style. I am ALWAYS returning clothes because I don't like the way things fit/look on me but this time I lucked out. I think this dress will look good on pretty much everyone. True it's not the best material but come on...it costs $17.00..what do you expect. How it will look after it's washed remains to me seen. Perhaps I should hold my thoughts for the dress until after washing. But I just pulled it out of the package and loving it."
5484,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Four Stars Soft material.
5485,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Loose Fit Fits loose but nice and warm.
5486,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Heavy duty This is a very heavy duty sweatshirt and the Amazon price was excellent for the quality. It is very well made with a side panel on both sides that make it fit really nicely. It isn't just a single side seam. I ordered it to make an ""ugly Christmas sweater"" and I hated to use it for that because it is so nice. I'll be back for more that I don't have to make ugly!"
5487,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Amazing

5490,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Come on, just order them!!! I‚Äôm 5 foot 4, about 175lb. I‚Äôve got thick thighs. I normally order a medium for all my leggings but I read a few reviews to size up... totally agree if you‚Äôve got any shape to your thighs. I love how smooth and comfy these feel. The waistband hits me right over my little gut, two fingers under my bellybutton. The ankle band is fairly snug, most joggers I get they are loose down there. The length is perfect, there‚Äôs a little bit of bagginess to them. Booty area is perfect, you know when you have a butt and your leggings kinda dip down in the back? Well these don‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm about to order these in all my favorite colors. Speaking of color, I ordered black... THANK THE BOOTY GODS BECAUSE THESE ARE SQUAT PROOF!!!"
5491,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Comfy and breathable I really like these. They‚Äôre comfy and very breathable. I have full range of motion when using them and I would purchase again!
5492,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Look flatteringly fit! I LOVE these tops!
5493,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Buy the XS if you have no boobs I bought an extra small (blue) and a small (pale blush) and I love the extra small. The small is just too big for me and I like a closer fit. I‚Äôm usually a small in tops and rarely if ever buy XS in anything. 27 inch waist and I think 32A in bra (Idk I usually wear stick on bras lol)
5494,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great purchase, quality items Great price for 3 quality athletic tank tops. Fits very nicely, and are super comfortable."
5495,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars It's a Christmas gift for my son
5496,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Love these pants These are so comfortable, great alternative to skinny leggings."
5497,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Cute summer dress I love the way it fits !!!
5498,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Shrinks with washing Super cute and comfy. It shrank after putting it thru a &#34;hand wash&#34; cycle on my washing machine or I would give it 5 stars.
5499,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Cute casual dress Versatile- I wore it with leggings for warmth and so I didn't have to be conscientious about every movement. Some of the colors could be easily dressed up.
5500,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"feels nice! These are very nice and feel silky against you.  It is doesn't feel that snug if you want them to hug you for support, though, so keep that in mind.  I ordered them for me but I selected too small of a size and instead of returning them, they fit my wife nicely so she got 3 new tanks :)"
5501,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,GREAT SHIRTS FOR THE PRICE~ AWESOME SHIRTS!!!!
5502,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Best comfy joggers ever I am obsessed with these. I‚Äôve bought 2 pair and I will definitely get a third. Got true to size. I got a medium- I‚Äôm actually 9 mos preg and they‚Äôre a tad tight so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be perfect once the baby is born. They are so comfortable and cute.
5503,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good product! Met my expectations. Ordered a small which was loose on me, after laundered fit was improved.<br />Pleased with the purchase."
5504,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Took a risk, WORTH IT. (SZ L) Okay so I was taking a leap getting this because I am so weird with joggers and sweats. I am not a fan of them being tight to my legs or butt. So as you can see they are form fitting on the thighs and butt but they are loose on the rest.  These are like legging/Drifit material and they are SOOO COMFY. I would order another one a size bigger but they would be far too big. That is just how they are supposed to fit and I have learned to love them. They have a high waisted yoga band and they have so much stretch.<br /><br />The only downfall for me personally is I had a significant weight loss so there is some left over skin that is visible with lines because the pants are that light material. So no cropped tees for me when I wear these but they are still great.<br /><br />Give them a try, you won‚Äôt regret it."
5505,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,üëå I‚Äôm happy customer just right and what I expected.
5506,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Exactly what I expected/wanted I love the simplicity and the comfort of sweaters like this. The medium fit me perfectly, and was in perfect condition. If you're checking the reviews to see how the quality holds up, then don't even worry about it and add it to the cart. It's legit."

5509,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable Sweatshirt This brand is a lighter weight than the Champion brand. The price on these sweatshirts is very good.
5510,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Awesome! Perfect for my daughter.

5513,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great Tank Tops These are a great set of tank tops. While I suspect most men purchase such tops for working out, I have been wearing them as undershirts for several years now. These fit as expected and I like the feel on my skin. They look nice as well."
5514,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Soft joggers.  Great brand quality product Comfy<br /> Love oalka leggings.  So soft

5516,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Excellent workout leggings I absolutely LOVE these leggings! I ended up buying them in light blue and black, as well as this gray color. They‚Äôre made of a really high quality material that has excellent stretch and doesn‚Äôt appear see through. I really like that they‚Äôre high compression but still breathable, so they‚Äôre perfect for workouts."

5523,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Awesome! Better than GymShark So flattering! I prefer these to my gymshark leggings and have them in multiple colors. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 3‚Äù and around 140. I bought size M and have plenty of stretch. Could possibly size down if you prefer a tighter fit

5527,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Just watch for some that have pockets and some dont These are my favorite comfortable pants I have them in 3 colors. I am 5 foot 2 inches and a little curvy, so I ordered medium and they are perfect. I have red, black and grey"
5528,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great joggers! These joggers are great! They fit like a medium. They aren't snug as a medium. So if you like the tighter look, go for a small. But I also loved these because of the drawstring. Ensures that I don't have to constantly worry about hiking up my pants when I'm working out. For reference, I'm 5'6, 150lbs. These fit great!"
5529,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Exactly what I want in a workout shirt. I hate the idea of paying a high price for a shirt I'm going to wear to the gym with the intention of sweating profusely in. After waisting way too much time searching for a low key, lightweight, and breathable gym tank, I found these and decided why not try for such an inexpensive price even though I was hesitant about the quality. I bought this shirt in 4 colors. They all came in today and after trying to first one on, I knew I had found the perfect workout shirt. The best part, they are inexpensive and easy to replace so when your workout shirt starts to look dingy from so much use, you don't feel bad recycling and buying another one. I'm about to buy a few more. These have such a great fit too - loose enough in the mid section but sitting perfectly on the hips/waist and not overly flowy. I'm 5'8, 120lbs, and wear a 30DD."

5533,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Good value These shirts are fairly thin, but I chose them mainly to wear as a base layer for winter hiking. They are comfortable and don't ride up. I'm 5'2"" 120lbs and I ordered the medium size. They are not overly tight which is what I wanted."
5534,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Buy it, it‚Äôs worth the money Nice garment, warm, soft and appears to be durable"
5535,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Heavyweight sweatshirt It is a nice, heavy sweatshirt made for winter not like those lightweight Fruit of the Loom sweatshirts that you can practically seem thru when you hold it up to a light."
5536,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Bawmbbbb Absolutely love these and how they fit my body. I got my pants size how I would order at Nike or Adidas. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 170 and I got a Large :)

5544,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Warm for fall, color is very good. Good quality for the price"
5545,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"True to size, and very cute! I read other reviews that said to order a bigger size as it was not a true fit. I am 5'4&#34; 150 pounds, normally a size large but ordered a XL. I received the shirt with Prime shipping, right on time like promised. Unfortunately the XL was way too big so I returned it the next day for free, already have received my refund, and placed an order for a large. The XL did cover my backside unlike other reviews noted, but every woman's body is different and beautiful in it's own way :)"
5546,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Comfy Fits well and wicks well too. I guessed on my size and its not too long or too loose anywhere
5547,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Retro hoodie Haven't received as many comments on a piece of clothing since high school (over 50 years ago). All were positive.
5548,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Soft and comfy This sweatshirt is a nice soft material inside and smooth doesn't pill up on the outside, it's just a little thinner than I expected but that's fine it's still a great hoody."
5549,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"comfortable Comfortable and warm, perfect for winter"
5550,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Tight fit Nice looking shirt and material.  I have 52 inch chest and 2XL is a bit tight
5551,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Delicate I love it besides it easily tears. Which is disappointing.  I have room in top but . I spotted a tiny hole on stomach area.  Second time wearing it. Thank god I have 2 more. But I love the fit so comfortable but needs stronger material for actual work out.
5552,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Bilateral mastectomy These tank tops are perfect compression for post double mastectomy care. They are long enough they don't roll up onto the incision sight and provide the support to keep the burning down.  Highly recommend
5553,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars its cool
5554,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice OG Sweatshirt It was refreshing to find this exact product that my husband has been looking for.  It has the OG fit with a gathered ribbing at the bottom and no hoodie.  The fabric is soft and the fit is perfect.  Excuse me while I place another order.
5555,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great Great
5556,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cool, Comfy, Flattering Dress Love this dress so much I just ordered a 3rd one. Very flattering, perfect for sweltering summer days in FL. Cool and lightweight and not shear."
5557,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Five Stars Perfect for and great looking, feels soft to your skin."
5558,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Backstrap takes getting used to. The fit and size were exactly as expected.  Shirts feel good and look good.
5559,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Sweatpants with logo love these very comfortable sweats..my only minor complaint is the pockets (which are convenient) but if you‚Äôre wearing with a t-shirt it can be unflattering.
5560,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"GOOD VALUE Attractive, lightweight, fashionable style....worth the reasonable price!"
5561,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Thick and warm Nice and comfortable
5562,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,cozy! Beautiful cardigan for fall
5563,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Mostly perfect. Like the shirts came when expected and how I thought they would look. I did wash the shirts and when I went to put them away... One appeared that it had hole wearing in the material. Otherwise I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
5564,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,Different colors fit differently I ordered 2 pair of these joggers; a teal(blue) pair and a Drawstring Cassis.  The blue pair with the flat wide waist was tighter in the waist and butt than the Drawstring pair.  It also seemed like the blue pair was made of a thinner material; you could see my underwear line.  The waist is also much higher.  The Drawstring pair fit more true to size and was more comfortable and because it's slightly thicker my panty line is less noticeable.  I'll most likely purchase other colors but only the Drawstring style.
5565,5,B009R09Z8W,1,I love it! Way brighter then I expected! I love it!
5566,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Simple and Lovely! This dress is perfect for summer and looks so cute with a jean jacket!  I'm ordering it in a 2nd color.  I'm 5'8 weigh 160 pounds and wear a size large.  It fits perfect!  The spaghetti straps are adjustable.  My 18yo daughter might even order one!!
5567,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"When in doubt, size up! I absolutely loved the shirts. I was doubting whether to get them large or xlarge and I'm happy i chose XL. They fit me perfectly although i would wish for them to be a little longer. it fits me a little short because of my boobs lol i am 4'11&#34; with 38DDD boobs."

5575,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Light weight Purchased in 3 different colors. These will be great with leggings, boots and a warm scarf. They are light weight but for winter have a good length. Cute."
5576,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Big, baggy sweatshit just what I was looking for - a baggy sweatshirt that fits over whatever else I'm wearing. Heavy enough to keep warm, but not so heavy you have to take it off as soon as you go inside."
5577,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Runs large I am using there fir compression after surgery.
5578,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Love it I love it & I will be buying more in various colors.

5583,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Comfortable and versitile Lots of compliments. Wear it with a short white undershirt beneath and red Crocs. Very comfy and versatile.
5584,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Definitely worth it. I was very sketchy on if ... Definitely worth it. I was very sketchy on if I should get a small since most times when I do, it's too small, but this one fit perfectly. I actually ordered another one and now I'm more excited."
5585,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Fits perfect! Really nice and comfy
5586,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Excellent ! Better quality than expected at this price. Serious fabric, well crafted."

5593,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Good quality Perfect for project
5594,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Nice color Thin fabric but soft.  Fit is good, not clingy.  Would like underarms to be higher."
5595,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Looking good! Fits great and very comfortable to wear. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 140 lbs and I thought it might be either too tight around the stomach (or just as bad, too oversized) or too short. It comes down right above the knee and is flattering around the stomach area (I‚Äôm average build but I hold all my weight in my stomach). Very pleased!"
5596,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Tight on chest, loose on stomach, perfect I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù close to 300 lbs, with a big stomach, this 3XL fits great on the chest and loose on the stomach. Covers all, looks great."

5598,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Just what I was looking for Just what I was looking for
5599,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Not bad Should have bought a smaller size.
5600,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Ok fit I use this product for the gym, the fit is ok just a little too loose and long for my liking"
5601,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect beautiful sundress! Five stars! I'm 5'2&#34; 130 lbs. I ordered the small. I'm big busted and the entire dress fits perfectly! The pockets are also amazing!  They're deep enough to be useful. I'm not sure about the negative reviews because the dress I received as already become my favorite! I'm ordered a second dress!
5602,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Well fitting Fits how i wanted.  I went a size up (usually XL) to XXL considering the compression.  Fits well
5603,4,B009R09Z8W,1,OK This hoodies is tight around the neck the elastic around the wrists and waist are pretty good no complaint there it is a tad tight so I would recommend getting once size above what you normally wear.  But overall it is a warm hoodie and I will enjoy wearing it this spring.
5604,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Super comfortable Really good product the material feels really good and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap I loved it will definitely buy again
5605,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Best tank tops My husband loves this mese tank to work out in.. this is the 3rd set we bought..

5609,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Fit well remember to follow the directions to company give you for correct size
5610,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfect summer dress I ordered this in blue - liked the fit/color/pockets - but the pattern along the neckline was off and it bothered me. Ordered two more, red and blue, and their stitching was perfect. I‚Äôve ordered other dresses fm Amazon and they never work, sewing, sizing, material, etc. problems. These I love. Ordered a size small despite my 34D chest, based on reviews. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and its sort of hi-lo length works great. Breezy, comfortable and stylish.<br />Amazon, more like these, please!"
5611,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Good product, especially for the cost. Great hoodie, especially for the price.  I like that it is not promoting something.  Fits right for a big guy."
5612,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Perfect fit Very comfortable,"
5613,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"cute, fabric on the thicker side i like the leggings but wish there was at least a small scrunch or seam at the butt so it can be more flattering. since the fabrics on the thicker side the compression flattens my butt lol.<br />im 5‚Äô4 150, slim muscular build and got small but would pick medium forsure and would probably be more flattering"
5614,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great flowy summer dress I loved the length and how flowy the dress is. It's comfy but pretty. It falls nicely but could use some definition with a belt but a snug cardigan works good too.
5615,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Comfortable Comfortable, but is a bit looser than I expected. Probably better to size down."
5616,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Very comfortable Awesome leggings for the price.  Very comfortable fit.
5617,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Love love love this dress!! Would order again.

5619,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"They run small, definitely order one size bigger if you don‚Äôt like tight fits. I liked the light weight of the shirt and the feel against me."
5620,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits Very Nice I ordered tis in a large the fit is nice - will reorder more
5621,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,shirt this item arrived in perfect condition. it was packed very carefully. I live in Alaska and it comes a long way to me and it was in perfect condition
5622,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Not as loose as expected. These shirts are comfortable. Only thing I do not like is they are not loose as expected. I got the 2xl cause that's what I generally wear. They are still wearable but if your wanting them to fit loose and baggy order a size up.
5623,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Fits pretty well I really like these tights. They fit well and are high quality. They are not see through and perfect for all workouts!!

5628,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,These are what dreams are made of LOVE!! Will be ordering in every size. I‚Äôm a small In Gymshark leggings so I ordered a small in the ear. They are PERFECT! They are compressive in the waist band but not as much in the legs. They are perfect for leg day too since they are not see through. Would 20582946295% recommend to anyone.
5629,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Amazing! I love these!!! Great fit, true to size. Squat proof. I'm ordering more!"
5630,5,B076QD9NP1,1,This is all my granddaughter wants to wear! Perfect fit and soft material.
5631,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Dry fit tight fit athletic top Wife liked it because it helps her to keep warm while walking outside in the wintertime!
5632,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,I didn‚Äôt like the cotton feel on the inside of the jacket I didn‚Äôt like the cotton feel on the inside of the jacket. I was expecting the whole jacket to be dri fit.
5633,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"best bang for buck, fits perfect, a bunch of lint but that is minor. very comfortable unless it is windy, obviously. if it's cold and windy brace yourself because all the wind will just go right through this hoodie."
5634,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great looking Good quality material.  Nice looking T's
5635,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"This dress combines all of her favorite things and she was so excited to get it I bought this dress for my three year old who loves dresses, cats, and rainbows. This dress combines all of her favorite things and she was so excited to get it. She loves it and it is in an adorable cut that makes her look so cute. I will be buying another one when she grows out of this size. It is perfect for her and she gets lots of complements on it.Its very well made and has held up to her rambunctious lifestyle.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount to provide an honest review, all opinions are my own."
5636,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Love them!! Love these shirts. Would wear them every single day if I owned more than 3 lol. I sized down (small) for a tight fit.
5637,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great for exercising Nice quality. Wash‚Äôs ip nice
5638,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,I really like the Russell Athletic brand This sweatshirt was everything I want a sweatshirt to be. It's a perfect addition for those colder days when I need to layer my clothes.
5639,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect! Soft, thick, and warm. My new favorite. They do run large, though. I usually wear a large, but a Medium fit just right. Much nicer than expected."
5640,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Buy this! These are SUPER soft and warm and fit perfect, definitely a great buy!"
5641,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Look like gymshark They look very nice! I love them!

5643,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Really like the sweatshirt Really like the sweatshirt. Colors are great! Expect that it will fit but haven't tried it since it is a Christmas gift. Service was fast & packaged well.
5644,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Seams So the seams are slightly off but otherwise they are good tanks.
5645,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Love it Very comfy.  Washes nice.  I enjoy wearing them around the house .  I own 3 now

5648,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love these I absolutely love these compression shirts for working out. They don't ride up and very moisture wicking

5654,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love the fit color and comfort Love the material and the fit
5655,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars I'm always happy with Russell Athletic products
5656,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Nice shirts Nice shirts for the price.
5657,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,I'ts a nice hoodie Can't go wrong for the price.  Metal zipper is superior to nylon zippers on some sweat Hoodies.
5658,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars The product arrived as expected and it fits my husband perfectly. He loves it!
5659,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Very flows and great if you like a loose fit It looked nice ultimately but arrived fairly wrinkled. It fits a bit tight around my chest and very loose everywhere else. Lucky for me it wasn‚Äôt too long for my 5‚Äô4‚Äù frame. I was able to tie it off a bit at the bottom and walk around all day.
5660,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love it Perfect
5661,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great fit and weight for a cool summer or fall evening or morning.  Perfect!
5662,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great look and fit Love the way the shirts fit and I've gotten compliments from them
5663,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great product Somewhat on the larger then expected, but it will probably shrink.  Great quality."
5664,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very nice! It's very good quality!
5665,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great buy This is a GREAT sweatshirt. It is a roomy, but not really too big. The fabric is sturdy and warm."
5666,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Offers no compression, but still a great item! Update: (11/19/18)<br />I ordered the small 3 pack black tank tops, but unfortunately USPS has lost track of my item.  It shows as delivered but I never received it.  As a result, and after reading a few of the other reviews, I have decided to keep the medium ones.  I am also upgrading my rating to 4 stars.  While the item offers no compression, I still find them very comfortable and well worth the money spent.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews, I decided to order the 3 pack black ones.  I ordered a medium though I normally wear small in T-shirts.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 135 lbs.  As soon as I opened the package I immediately knew that they were a little big for me.  From my perspective, they seem to run true to their size label.  I own a pair of other compression tops and these ones fail in comparison.  These feel more like high quality tank tops to me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Material is very soft and stretchy.<br />Good replacement for tank tops.<br />Affordable price.<br /><br />Cons: No compression.<br /><br />I still give this item 3 stars because of the quality and I am planning to order a small because, as I stated, they are a good replacement for tank tops.  I will update this review if the replacement ones tend to offer any compression.  For now, I would suggest order the size that is the same as your shirts for slim fit, and order a size above for regular fit."
5667,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"GREAT shirt, but runs small so order a size up. Purchased these for my husband.  He is athletic built at 6'4&#34; and 230 lbs. He normally would wear XL, but after reading all the reviews I decided to order XXL and they fit perfectly!  They do run a bit small, but they don't shrink and they are nice and cool for hot days working out. Great fabric and well made.  He absolutely loves them and now has 6 in different colors."
5668,4,B09M6X79V9,1,They work and the price is right My wife has been having some  back trouble and these compressinon shirts are helping  her to take much less of her medication  thanks
5669,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love it! Love it!
5670,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Amazon on line ordering is awesome. It is my style.
5671,5,B0B16Q1854,1,So soft Beautiful color and made well! My new favorite
5672,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Perfect for leg day I love these leggings. They are perfect for leg day because they are squat proof. They are so comfy and hug all the right places. I bought the same brand crop long sleeve shirt in Malibu blue so I wish they had these leggings in that color so I could match but this is a great color as well.
5673,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Great dress A great dress for my teen daughter.  She put a Jean jacket over it but she loves it!
5674,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Comfy and warm but very hefty
5675,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great fit I keep ordering these - love em
5676,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,My sons favorite It fits great and my adult son is very picky! One of his favorites
5677,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"It's pretty but... I like this dress. It fits as expected and I like the color. But the fabric is thin. You can pull and stretch the fabric and it's a little sheer, too. I was expecting it to have a little more heft to it.  I'm a little self conscious without wearing a slip underneath."
5678,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfort I like my sweatshirts larger than my normal size for comfort. This sweatshirt was priced right and it keeps me warm.
5679,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Love this cute dress!! Perfect little dress...so comfortable, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 125... small fit perfect...Bought it late in the season so I‚Äôm happy we had a warm day so I could wear it!!"
5680,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"It‚Äôs a Russell! Good fit, good quality, good value. It‚Äôs a Russell."
5681,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Something that looks good. Love these. Very comfortable yet look great.
5682,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,They really fit great!!! The shirt makes me look built!!
5683,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,MY FAVORITE I have 2 pairs of this same color. Literally my favorite leggings. So flattering. The material is stretchy breathable. Right amount of tight. And the band is thick and the right amount of tight. Love always recommend and people always ask where they‚Äôre from
5684,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Excelente producto Las camisetas cumplieron las expectativas . Muy c√≥modas y mantienen en el cuerpo una temperatura agradable.
5685,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Fit Excellant liner, fit great"
5686,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Butter Joggers These joggers feel like butter. They are thick and do not look cheap at all. Would by again !
5687,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"If the Shirt fits, it never quits My son loves it."
5688,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect! Love the fit. Fast shipping.
5689,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Great lightweight top Great lightweight top.
5690,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,So IMPRESSED! I will be ordering more colors! These are probably one of my favorite leggings. I got a size small I am 5‚Äô1 and 130lbs. Considering my height I thought they were going to be super long at my ankles but these are perfect. I wore them to the gym and I am just impressed. There is a slight camel toe problem so I would suggest to size up since they fit snug anyway.
5691,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfy fit Very comfortable
5692,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great I‚Äôve and fitted
5693,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Love these! These are perfect for outdoor running/walking. The hidden pocket in the back is the perfect place to hold my cell phone. The two pockets in front are deep. I can put my car keys in the front pocket and they don't rub against my leg. (Something that happens with other joggers with small pockets). Also, they keep me warm but are not so hot that it's uncomfortable.<br /><br />I also have a pair of Oalka joggers that are shorter in length. I bought these a year ago and they don't wear out or shrink when washed. I highly recommend this brand!"
5694,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love that jacket Love this jacket
5695,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Perfect for running Perfect for running, yoga, or just athleisure wear. My only complaint is that the fabric doesn't breath as well as I thought it would. It's definitely not 100% cotton, more of a synthetic blend and so your boob sweat gets suuuper trapped and so I found myself taking it off and just wearing a sports bra during a cycle class. Still a good buy for the price, I'd purchase again in different colors."
5696,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Love them! I love them!! They‚Äôre so comfy and they‚Äôre great for activity. I bought these for hiking in Utah in July, very comfy. I didn‚Äôt drown in sweat and it wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable. There were smaller than expected so I‚Äôd suggest a size or two up."
5697,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Comfortable sweat shirt.
5698,5,B009R09Z8W,1,It fits perfect! Love it
5699,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Great quality, price is great, feels nice and soft, a little on the big side but not complaining about it i like it"
5700,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Flattering I bought this dress is a different color and loved it so much I bought a second one. The dress is flattering and cute. Like many other reviewers, I tied (a loose knot) in the strings and swung the knot around to the keyhole - which I wear in the back. I may even buy a 3rd dress since all the patterns are so lovely!"
5701,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Best summer dress!!! Perfect BoHo dress!!!
5702,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Size I love them. If you want them to be a true compression, go a size down. I‚Äôm a medium and bought a small. Perfect."
5703,5,B097RFTKJP,1,So comfortable to wear One of the most comfortable dresses I‚Äôve ever worn and very sleek and attractive! Love the material too!
5704,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"worth the buy The shirts were perfect, but one had a weird scent stuck to it.."
5705,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Moisture wicking Product fit true to size
5706,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Wow! Got my first pack in, tried one on immediately. Went straight back to Amazon to order a second pack. Great Great Great."
5707,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"I liked the garment I liked the garment, goodfeeling material and very comfortable.  I found I needed a smaller size since I wanted a very snug fitting garment"
5708,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great Value! Great value!
5709,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Best hoodie Best hoodie ever!!!!  Soft, warm, great quality, wish I would have bought more."
5710,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Would buy again My husband wanted a plain zip hoodie and this is perfect. Nice price, excellent fit."
5711,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good hoodie for everyday.
5712,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Jerzees Men's 996 price and style great! color awesome . Took a long time to get to me but worth the wait
5713,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Perfect workout leggings Really great addition to my workout clothes!  Very comfy, not see through and no camel toe üëå"
5714,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Light Blue Hoodie Although I bought this hoodie for a certain time. I didn't try it on until the time comes for me to wear it. I like my hoodies big so I can layer it over a t-shirt for the fall & spring. For the winter I will wear it layered over a turtleneck. When it gets frigid out I will layer it over a sweater or crewneck sweatshirt. Because Buffalo,NY demands for me to be warm at all times. I love the unique color. And the bigness is great for me. That's why I order 1 size up. It helps to camouflage my weight. I'm very happy with my purchase."
5715,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good quality, warm, nice color...would purchase again I'm a hoodie fanatic and this hoodie fits the bill. I got it in the heather and the color looks very nice. I got the large and it fits exactly the way i like it.....fitted, not tight, good sleeve length, bottom at the waist. I would buy again."
5716,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Very comfortable body-hugging tank I love these tanks so much!  I think they are very flattering.  They have a little bit of compression to them, so they're body-hugging and slimming.  Now, they don't have the kind of compression to hold in a lot, so don't expect miracles, but they hold in just enough to make you feel like a slightly slimmer version of yourself.<br /><br />They are not too short.  I hate when shirts are too short and they ride up and the little belly pooch starts to stick out.  These don't do that.  I really like the way the fabric feels on my skin.<br /><br />Now of course, if you're not into body-hugging and are looking for more of a loose fit, these are not what you want.  But I wanted something that made me feel slimmer and a little bit sexy when working out.<br /><br />I've enjoyed them so much I bought a second pack that I wear around the house on hot summer days.  They're so comfortable, I'll wear them to sleep too."
5717,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Love these sweats and POCKETS! These fit perfectly! And I love the pockets! I wash on delicate and hang to dry.
5718,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice item, good value, Nice item, good value, Thick and warm... a good buy"
5719,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Should have bought more Very pleased with the products there are no dislikes
5720,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice I have purchased two of these sweatshirts for my grandson.  He loves the color and the style.  Perfect weight for fall.
5721,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good Fit & Value Nice sheer sleeveless under shirt with good shaping. Very cool to wear in the hot days of summer.  Give these a try - XL is my normal size and XL with these undershirts fit well.
5722,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Fits great! Got em for working out and for undershirts and they fit perfect
5723,5,B009R09Z8W,1,... had to shrink it a couple of times looks good and is soft love Got an EXL and had to shrink it a couple of times looks good and is soft love it
5724,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"So cute and comfy I have an apple-shaped body, thick tummy, and this dress hides it so well! Nice fabric that lays well and the perfect length. True to size.  Will be buying more!"
5725,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Top Quality Sweat Shirt. Very Well Made ,Top Quality Sweat Shirt."
5726,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Definitely will buy again This dress fit very well. Not too sheer and not too clingy. Very pleased with this purchase
5727,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Exceeds Expectations for the Price It's inexpensive but not cheap. The hoodie is what you want on a winter day on the couch or a cold morning jog. It's oversized and warm and well-made. This is not some fashion hoodie. It's pure comfort. They run a size large, which is great. Again-that's comfort hoodie size. I love this hoodie."
5728,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good look, quality, and value. Over a year of wear at the gym, they have held up well after repeated washings. I would order these again."
5729,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great fit for a good, hard workout I found these to be quite comfortable and The fit is just right for lifting.  Some of the Y-backs tend to barely cover your chest, whereas these are perfect.  They are great at wicking the sweat and wash well.  Definitely buying again"
5730,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Material wasn't the best but it was very inexpensive Fun free-flowing with pockets. It fit me  a little weird in chest and under arms though
5731,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Buy for bust size These are stretchy and flattering for a curvy girl. I am large busted (40DDD) and bought XL in several colors and they all look great. Pockets size is medium, it is  the size of my hands. Medium weight, not see threw but not heavy. I wear these by themselves, with leggings, and for pajamas."
5732,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"New fav My new favorite undershirt but can be worn as just a tank top. Fits perfectly, figure flattering."
5733,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Love it
5734,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Four Stars Fits like a normal tank top. However I was hoping it would provide a bit more compression.
5735,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Daughter loves these dresses The dresses are adorable and my 5 yr old loves them. First one we bought was the rainbow kitten one, she asked for another because she loved it so much so we went with the donut printed one. She seems to be very comfortable in them and is always asking to wear them so I‚Äôll eventually have to buy more. Fits true to size."
5736,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great work replacement for the classic under shirt cotten tank. Normal size is US L for a regular fit.  In this shirt had to buy a US XXL or Euro XXXL for a regular fit.  If had wanted a snugger fit probably XL because the material is stretchy like spandex.  It wicks well and is light weight under clothing.  Only drawback in direct sun you do feel the heat in these dark colors.
5737,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Size down You definitely get whats in the picture and they were nice i just had to return them becuase they run a little too big<br />Definitely size down if youre getting these !
5738,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I love them, now I want the blue one. they're better than my Champion hoodies love how they fit happy they arrived at said time I will be ordering the blue hoodie in my next order"
5739,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great Great sweatshirt. Just don't let the strings touch any velcrow.
5740,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good fit My husband liked the fit and wanted more as it is hard to get the correct fit.
5741,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fit Fits as described
5742,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars ok
5743,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great tanks for the price! Soft, snug fitting tank top.  Very affordable for my work outs."
5744,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,I would definitely recommend Perfect for morning walk. Use it as an under layer too. Fabric breathes much better than expected.
5745,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Would definitely give them a try! The best so far LOVE. I bought the black first and they were so nice, a little see through when bending over but comfy and fit so well so i bought the gray pair and they are a little thicker and only like 1% see through! They are a tight fit, like spandex. I love they material they are made from, not cotton, but soft and so stretchy. Also no front seam so no camel toe!"
5746,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Bought for wife as a gift She loved it, sizing guide was accurate enough for a clueless husband to find his wife‚Äôs size and the fit was there when it arrived."
5747,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Runs Small This price runs small, so be aware of that otherwise it‚Äôs a good product."
5748,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,A good deal Fits perfectly for me- roomy and not tight around the shoulders-my preference. Will get another at this attractive price-$20 is very reasonable.
5749,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Love it! Love this dress!! Always get several compliments!
5750,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great fit really warm good product.
5751,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Excellent freedom of movement while lifting. One shirt was defective and thread started unraveling on bottom of shirt. I am sending the one shirt back and I see with free return shipping. Woohoo.<br />  I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 with athletic build and 46-47 chest and these fit nice. Not too loose and not tight. The arm opening could be larger but this is probably person specific. I ordered one more set of black because I liked them more than my under armor compression shirts.
5752,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Always a great fit and durable fabric.
5753,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Nice quality material I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 180 pounds. I ordered size Large in navy blue. The fit is perfect, slightly loose around the thighs, just what I was looking for. I‚Äôm super happy with my choice and I‚Äôm going to get be a pair in black as well."

5762,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great These shirts are great for working out. I love them, I weigh 135 and I ordered a small. It‚Äôs not at all tight, I like some room in a shirt when I work out. People were saying that they are cheap, I think they are soft and comfortable."

5788,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Always-Cold-Husband-Approved ‚úÖ Is your husband always cold, even when it‚Äôs only 67 degrees outside? How about when it‚Äôs 70 degrees in the house? Then this cost-effective, uber-comfortable, and dad-bod-flattering sweatshirt is for him (and you)! Next time dear husband begins his tirade about the ‚Äúchilly‚Äù weather, all you have to do is remind him that he has a sweatshirt - and also probably remind him where exactly in the closet to find it. And then go find it for him yourself after he fails to see it in the closet. Ah, marriage!"
5789,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Tide fit Great colors and fabric. Constantly have to pull down when exercising.
5790,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Love this dress! Flattering on! Not see through! Nice!

5798,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Russell quality I have some Russell sweatshirts from 20 years ago. This one is that same good quality and comfort.
5799,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Pretty Fast..Nice and different.
5800,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Looks nice, fits well, lasts Exactly what I wanted in a simple workout tank top. It looks nice, fits well and has stood up to many wash cycles already. Will definitely be buying these again when the need arises."
5801,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Four Stars Great fit, very comfortable"
5802,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Nice tank for the price!! I love the big arm holes! I like this tank top! I got a large, because I don‚Äôt like skin tight tanks and prefer a looser fit. I could have done a medium, but did a little tie(knot) in the side and it was cute. Loved working out in it, nice and cool! I really like the big arm holes!"
5803,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell brand Quality I've had Russell athletic clothing for decades!  The quality is tops for every day, casual use in my opinion!"

5806,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great value for a good product Awesome muscle shirts for working out! Love the fit and the definition it gives me
5807,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Soon comfy. These have become my go to lay around the house all day pants.  That's a high compliment.  It asked me to grade the 'stretch' but these don't stretch.  The waist band does of course, but not the pant legs.  The part in front of my stomach - not flattering.  But around the house cozy days? Don't care. Highly recomend.  This is my 2nd pair."
5808,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfort Waist tends to ride up a little bit but still fits better than the Hanes counterpart I have in the same size and color.
5809,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfy Great simply hoodie, just like I like. Good material, good quality, and it fits great."

5814,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very happy! The one thing that I must add is that you follow the instructions exactly when washing these. If you wash gently in cold water and tumble dry on low setting, the color will not run and they will hold their original fit."
5815,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great purchase I bought joggers similar to these at old navy, I decided to order these because they are 1/2 the price and was very pleased with my purchase! The quality is great!"
5816,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Everything I thought they‚Äôd be I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 10‚Äù 195 lbs and I bought the large pack with the black/grey/green colors. The material feels kind of similar to a practice jersey for basket ball or whatever sport you may have played. The fit is incredible and these have definitely became my favorite gym/sporting tops! I would recommend these to anybody and the price for what you get you really can‚Äôt beat it. Just follow the size guide and you‚Äôll be just fine.
5817,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Great hoodie! When I ordered this hoodie, I was looking for a lighter weight one for the cool spring mornings and nights.  I also prefer my hoodies to fit a bit bigger for extra roominess.  This hoodie met all of my expectations, and the bright color is fun too.  Plus you can't beat the price.  I'm thinking about ordering more colors for myself and my husband, as well."
5818,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Accurate fit, good feel I like the fit and feel of the smooth material.  It is formfitting so my burrito/dessert baby might show at times.  The sleeves are eighth at the wrist.  The neckline is nice and open."
5819,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fit Fit fine

5823,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Love it This is my second time buying this and it wont be the last I love the undershirts  nice and tight, keep me cool and feel good"
5824,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Super soft.  Super comfy. Just what I was looking for.  It's super soft, and super comfy.  I usually wear Under Armour ""loose"" fit in a small.  So I ordered medium in this shirt just in case.  It fits me exactly like I wanted.  Does NOT hug my curves, which makes it more flattering and looks better.  Please note, I wanted a more loose fit, which is why I ordered up.  We'll see how it holds up in workouts and wash!  :)"
5825,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,:) Like the style. Little big in the shoulder area. Otherwise fits well.
5826,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Breathable and Dri-fit Purple small fit well, although an inch shorter would make it perfect; 5'2"", 128 lbs.  Played 3 hours of volleyball in 80+ degree dry air weather and while my pony tail was dripping with sweat, this kept me dry and cool!  Also, no sweat stains."
5827,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars I love this dress! I can't wear it enough.
5828,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"new favorite hoodie Got this for my teen son and he really likes it. Fits well, is very soft and so far holding up well. Washed and dried at least 5 times, the color still looks good and it didn't shrink at all.<br />I ordered the Large, he is 6'3"" and 170 pounds. fit is perfect."
5829,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Good Athletic Top I love the colors and feel of the material in these tops. I would definitely order these again. I typically wear a small and like a fitted top but I like how the medium fits better with these tops. You may want to size up. I'm 5'6 and 145 lbs for reference.
5830,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Perfecto Perfecto
5831,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Very nice Light weight, comfort, workout joggers"
5832,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Not what I was expecting! 2/15/2017:  Update<br />This seller reached out to me after I left a review stating it wasn't what I expected as far as the large polka dots.<br />This dress is comfortable and I am able to dress it up or dress it down.  The dots are larger then expected, but other then that, thank you for this considerate seller who reached out to me to make sure I was happy with the product.  I will be purchasing from this seller again.<br /><br />A lot of material that feels nice on and love that there are pockets.  However, what's advertised is much much  smaller polka dots. What I received were big polka dots on a black background.  Ugh!!!!!!!"
5833,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Love these! Love these!
5834,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Amazing summer dress I am 5'4"", 120 lbs. I got the Navy Blue and Polka Dot in medium and it fits the way I wanted it to. Super billowy and breezy. No sheer issues that I know of as I got the dark blue, but the fabric is a lovely, lovely, smooth fabric with a beautiful weight to it. The dress moves so beautifully. The spaghetti straps are adjustable slide straps so if the neckline is too low for you, you can definitely adjust it.<br />I love, love, love this dress. Also...ready for this?..... IT HAS POCKETS!!! Thank you very much."
5835,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Perfect fit This is exactly ever I wanted.  I needed a long sleeve that could go under my work shirt. I work in a busy restaurant and I‚Äôm cold in the winter.  These are Perfect, perfect weight,<br />They are a perfect fit, with good movement no restriction"
5836,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great fit This is a PERFECT Gymshark doupe. The waist band is not too tight at the waist but tight enough to suck everything in.
5837,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Good value for the money Although these yoga pants are not as flattering as Lulu Lemon, they are less than half the price and a good value for the money.  The fabric appears to be of good quality and holds it's shape.  The fit is perfect, I am 5'6"" 140 lbs and I bought the medium."
5838,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice! Great exercise shirt! Rides up a little but not bad.
5839,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice singlet for the price With the bitter cold weather we've been having, my running and biking have been limited to a treadmill and bike trainer on my sunporch, which is at 55F.  I was looking for a base layer for under a long sleeve T.  I'm 6'1"", 155lbs - the medium fit perfectly, and is very comfortable - no chaffing during a two-hour run."
5840,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Excellent so far! This review is solely based off me trying them on. They are incredibly comfortable (likely my most comfortable leggings), fit perfectly, and look great.<br /><br />If I use them and after a few washes they still hold up, this review will stay them same. Great for the price!"
5841,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great quality Great quality similar to gymshark
5842,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good value Have not worn it yet, except for fit.  I am tall and athletic and purchased a large.  It fits a little tight, but not too tight.  Would have liked to try an extra large for grins.  Hope it holds up and doesn‚Äôt shrink in the wash."
5843,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great price and fit...washes nice. Many colors. Will order again soon. Ordered medium first. I like form fitting.. Ordered small...fits great

5848,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Very nice shirts! Nice fit, don‚Äôt shrink in wash"
5849,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Nice quality but too short I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù with long legs and these joggers were a little too short for me (hit above ankle) so I am returning them. Otherwise the quality seemed good and they were soft and comfortable. I wish they were just an inch or so longer.
5850,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Hoodie I like It Larger! It's Perfect nice & Thick pretty color! Great for workin out or just casual! Gotta get more colors for myself

5853,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"100% recomendables Son super c√≥modas e incre√≠bles tanto para salir a hacer ejercicio como para estar en la casa. Compr√© la XS tal como lo sugiri√≥ la gu√≠a de tallas y comparando con las camisetas que tengo en casa y no hubo equivocaci√≥n, pues me quedaron perfectas. Se ven incre√≠bles y valen cada centavo del costo. Volver√© a comprar otro pack pronto porque para estar en casa en d√≠as calurosos funciona estupendo."

5855,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"High waist and stay up while working out I‚Äôve only worn these leggings once but love the high waist and comfort.  Worked out in them and they stayed in place which was great!  I purchased and small and medium.  I kept medium and returned small as I don‚Äôt like them super duper tight.  I‚Äôm 40, mom bod (üòÇ) 5‚Äô3 and 125 lbs."
5856,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Daughter loves it! Im always nervous about buying dresses for my 6 year old because she's on the taller side, but this one was perfect! I got a 6-7y/o the length was just below the knee, it's super soft, light weight and flowy! She wears this dress all the time!"

5865,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits! Loves these!
5866,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Awesome product! The quality is great. Quite surprised. I own various compression shirts of different brands, and these fit right in with the others. Fits true to size. Catches and holds moisture as intended."
5867,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice product nice price Was a little concerned ordering this, but the size is true for me even after washing and drying. It is mid weight and what I was looking for, might order another one !"

5872,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great price and fit. Love these shirts. Perfect for keeping me warm and covered underneath my grooming smock. I'm 5'9 165 and ordered the XL. I was worried they wouldn't be long enough but they fit great. Love that I could purchase 3 for the price of one shirt that's very similar. Will be buying more and I recommend.
5873,5,B097RFTKJP,1,I have  bought a couple of these dresses and they fit perfect. They offer so many color choices it's had to pick. I'm impressed with the quality and fit. All this for the money I paid.

5881,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Pleasant Suprice I purchased this hoodie to replace my beloved hoodie I've had for a few years now.<br />I wanted the same gray color to keep the tradition going of having one.<br />This hoodie is light, but yet it keeps you very warm.<br />I purchased it oversized to layer without having to wear a big coat<br />while driving. I will be ordering different colors once they are back in stock<br />Well worth the purchase."

5894,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Sweatshirt This sweatshirt runs a little large. I normally wear a large but on the advice of other posters, I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly This is thicker than some (champion and fruit of the loom) but not as thick as carhartt. But to be fair, it does not cost 45 to 65 dollars like the carhartt brand does. I think I will be switching to Russell for sweats and hoodies in the future."
5895,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Received on time and as promises

5900,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Cute! I have 5,10‚Äù 185lbs and I got a XL because I don‚Äôt like too tight! As you can see this is totally flattering and it has room to be comfortable- I did not get this for compression just because it looked cute to wear. Does not hold u in if that‚Äôs what your looking for"
5901,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Comfortable and soft Color is not as pink as the picture makes it but it is very comfy
5902,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great for working out! Love this tank for working out, arm holes are really large and neck is a bit high but it is comfortable and breathable."

5904,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"This is an awkward thing to mention... I have, and love, one of these hoodies.  On my latest order, Amazon sent a brand X hoodie instead (so I donated it to a thriftshop).  Check your order.  The Russell Athletic hoodie is comfortable, fits well, and holds up well through repeated washings."

5923,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,My friend loves it! This was a Christmas gift for a friend and he simply loved it! It fit as expected and was a color he enjoys.
5924,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great value and look. Love the spandex support fit. Comfortable fit, washes well ."
5925,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great fit!  Comfortable to work out in. Love the material and the way it fits. It‚Äôs somewhat contour fit and long enough to not ride up!  I ordered 3x
5926,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Outstanding A must buy...they are beautiful perfect fit...length... They do creep up this is an amazing workout dry fit shirts!!
5927,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Color is much lighter than what is shown in the ... Color is much lighter than what is shown in the image.  It's almost a fluorescent red, not a darker red as the image appears.  but still cute."
5928,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Very satisfied! Fits perfectly. Usually the tanks tops I buy end up being too short. These are perfect length.
5929,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Husband likes these I got these as a Christmas present for my husband and he really likes them. They are more see through than I thought they would be, they‚Äôre more of a mesh dry fit rather than soft"
5930,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great shirts though These workout type shirts run small. I'm a size 8/10 and needed an xl/XXL. Great shirts though.
5931,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Best sweatshirt around! Russell sweatshirts are by far the best sweatshirt out there...I have 2 now and will be ordering more...they are thick like a sweatshirt should be and warm!  Paid an awesome price on Amazon too...you can't go wrong with the Russell Brand and they are the Dri Power ones too.
5932,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable It‚Äôs not ‚Äúcompression‚Äù fit. But, it‚Äôs cute and comfortable."
5933,5,B09M6X79V9,1,No show when wearing under other clothes. Comfortable and breathable.
5934,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Good quality I like that the shirts are really long. I love the feel of the fabric. Kept me warm during cold winter runs.
5935,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Literally AMAZING I have bought all the big Amazon workout leggings, so believe me when I say that these are the BEST ones yet. It‚Äôs the same style as Gymshark, but softer, higher waisted, and not as stiff. I lift 3-4 times a week, and these leggings are SQUAT-PROOF. They have good compression, but will definitely show a bloated stomach. High high waisted, good length, and the pattern makes my butt pop.<br /><br />For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù. I weigh 130, and am muscular on my lower body. I was torn between S and M, and got the small. Medium may have worked, but the small is perfect as long as it doesn‚Äôt shrink in the wash. Can‚Äôt wait to buy more pairs, and we‚Äôll see how well it lasts over time!"
5936,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Favorite leggings! These are my favorite leggings! This brand is the best they have so many good styles. I trust this brand. All my leggings are aoxjox!
5937,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Just buy it. I want a pair of these in every color. So awesome.
5938,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"Thin, but true to size! I got this dress for part of my Halloween costume. It is a tad thin but about what I expected. It fit as expected which I was happy about because that was my main concern. The top part is more clingy so if you‚Äôre looking for a looser flowing dress on top go a size up!"
5939,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Excellent product this is 3rd order of this garment Very good tank wicks away moisture and comfortable washes up great
5940,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love it Gift for my daughter and she loves them

5942,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,good fit Good fit
5943,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Good Like design kinda small fit
5944,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Perfect fit and arrived early. This is just the perfect sundress I was looking for, not too long, not too short. I am 5'2"" and weigh 140 lbs, and I bought a Medium, according to my measurements on the size chart, and it fit just perfectly. I loved the color, I bought print 101. Although it shipped from China, it arrived much earlier than expected, about a month before. I am very pleased with this purchase, and would buy from them again."
5945,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,üòÑüòÑüòÑ Very comfortable.

5948,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell Athletic Wear Fleece Crewneck I read the reviews and bought them one size smaller and they fit perfectly, I usually wear 2X but I bought XL and they fit right!"
5949,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Quality Product My husband, who is picky about comfort, is pleased with the quality and fit.  We plan to buy him a few more in different colors."
5950,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great gymshark dupe these leggings are super flattering and they‚Äôre light. no wedgie in the front or back lol
5951,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great length for petite ladies! The pros are the pockets, the polka dots, and the length. I'm 5 feet with shoes on and it's so hard to find a maxi that I'm not tripping on. It's the perfect length, and I love the loose fit.<br /><br />The con is that it's pretty see through. If I were going to the shore, this is perfect. But I couldn't wear it to work or out without a slip and tank and that wasn't Part of my plan when I bought this."
5952,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,... ordered this 1 size bigger than normal because I like a loose fitting sweatshirt I ordered this 1 size bigger than normal because I like a loose fitting sweatshirt. The other reason  I ordered bigger is because over the years I've gone cheap and bought those cheap Walmart sweatshirts for $6.00 that are thin and shrink to an infant size. These shirts are thicker and hold up very well when you follow the washing tag.<br />Order the normal size you wear with confidence. You will be satisfied.
5953,5,B009R09Z8W,1,These sweatshirts are super comfortable and soft These sweatshirts are super comfortable and soft. I bought four of them and want two more colors that I will buy soon.
5954,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Good product Nice
5955,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love it. I love this dress. I feel feminine in it. I'll be ordering another. I'm 5'4&#34;, 138 lbs. 36-29-40. Ordered a medium- perfect! Washed cold, hang dry."
5956,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Fits great Great product!
5957,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"ok vakue, take care to dry carefully to retain shape and sizing retains its shape, retains color, doesn't shrink too much, be sure to dry on LOW heat if you use dryer, otherwise hang dry."
5958,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"C√≥moda y ajuste perfecto! Muy c√≥modas para hacer ejercicio, me gusto la tela y el color!"
5959,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Thanks for the great deal and fast shipping.
5960,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sweatshirt They are not for me so I have no idea how they fit
5961,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice garment.  Better service. I found this hoodie to be nicer than expected.  But the service from Joe'sUSA when taking care of a situation with the delivery was a lot better. Will be calling again!
5962,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love these pants! I'm about 5'2 and 135lbs so I have some flab on me and I got high waisted mediums. I probably could have gotten a small if I wanted a tight fit but I didn't so the mediums are perfect.<br />The high waist isn't too tight but I know it will keep the pants up. The legs are just the right amount of baggie so it's not like you are wearing a second skin and showing off all you got like most workout pants are these days. The material feels nice and thick but I wore them in the heat and was pleased that they didn't make me feel hot or get swamp crotch lol.<br />I'm definitely going to buy another pair!
5963,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great fit and color, downside is they are polyester Really heavy duty fabric, not a cheap see through pant. I love the fit. They are slightly loose like runners, not completely tight like leggings. I am considering buying another pair. The reason I did not rate 5 stars is because they are polyester. So, eventually they will be stained beyond wearing."
5964,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Can't go wrong Wonderful color rich & vibrant.........fits well.......very happy with my purchase
5965,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great summer dress I bought this dress for a swimsuit cover up. Worked great!  I'm 5'2&#34; and it just brushed the ground in the back. I'm not saying its fancy and I don't know if it's sewn well, but its meeting all my needs plus some. I decided to wearing with a sports bra as just a casual summer dress as well."
5966,5,B07XD71F1H,1,My wife likes it My wife likes the fit and cut. She is very particular in her taste and this works.
5967,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Five Star Excelente, muy c√≥modas y de buen material."
5968,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good qualityüëï They feel good on my skin. Dry quicklyüëï‚ù§
5969,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars good item
5970,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Fits just right It fit great, my only issue was that I received the package opened. Nothing was missing, just didn‚Äôt like that it was opened."
5971,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Love it So cute, fits great"
5972,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Nice Nice, cool shirt for hot summer days! Fit perfect and just ordered 3 more."
5973,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,GREAT SWEATSHIRT MY HUSBAND HAS ALWAYS LOVED THESE SWEATSHIRTS AND OVER THE YEARS HAS HAD ABOUT EVERY COLOR.  EACH YEAR HE NEEDS A NEW WHITE AND RED ONE.  NONE OF THE STORES BEFORE OR AFTER CHRISTMAS HAD ANY RED BUT AMAZON DID.  GOOD JOB.  WILL COME BACK HERE AGAIN TO ORDER.
5974,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Sleeveless Hoodie Very nice work out hoodie. Fits as expected, snug but not tight. Hood fits well, but if you like a little hang in the hood you may want to consider a larger size. Very light weight, so light the wind, if strong enough will blow it back. Stays dry enough while in a good sweat, holds back the stink pretty well too so you won't have to worry about it stinking up the car, locker, or bag. Logo is small and I wouldn't consider it a safe reflective warning to and potential hazards. May end up buying myself some more in the future."
5975,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Amazing purchase I freaking love them!
5976,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Super comfy Bought for my daughter and she loves these. They are true to size and lightweight.
5977,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Great look Wasgoid
5978,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Wish I'd have gotten 2 of these well constructed sweatshirts, true to size. I bought this for my 6'4"" husband who wears 2XL. This was sized right & fit perfectly. Overall good quality. Wears and washes well. Fabric is thick and sweatshirt is warm. Best of all, my husband likes it and wears it often!"
5979,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Recomendable Esperaba algo de mayor calidad, pero se los recomiendo es s√∫per caliente"
5980,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,The Opinion It was for my husband so I could only go by what he said.  He said he liked it. okay
5981,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Gorgeous dress! This is one of my favorite dresses for the summer time. Although it is a little shorter than the pictures shows even with the straps fully extended. More like a mid-calf length for my 5ft 7in. Regardless, I love this dress and would recommend it."
5982,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Finally! I've tried 3 different full zip hoodies at this price point and this Russell is hands down the best. After a warm water wash and thrown in the dryer it fits great. The wrist and waist bands stay snug. It did shrink a little but not to much. I think everyone expects a hoodie to shrink a little. The best part is it shrank proportionally. If you're like me you want a hoodie you can just throw in the washer and dryer without having to worry about it coming out fitting differently. I'm 6'1"" 190 lbs with an athletic build and the XL is a perfect fit after a wash and dry. If you like a looser fit like an XL Carhartt, I would go with a XXL Russell. I have both and I like how the XL Russell fits perfect. My XL Carhartt fits a little baggy."
5983,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Buy a size larger! LILBETTER, kindly sent me another in the place of the one that was too small."

I pair it with a belt, leggings & knee high boots. Color & material has held up after many washes. Had a stain on the back that came out in 1 wash. Many compliments, highly recommend."
6015,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Best knockoff around So, first these are the Best Buy I‚Äôve found on compression shirts. They are under armour quality and seriously a fraction of the price. I do recommend you buy a size larger than you normally would as they run pretty small, but will recommend to anyone."

I went out in a limb and ordered a small cause it looked like it had a lot of room and I wanted to make sure it didn‚Äôt hit the ground, and it fit great. It was snug in the chest area which was totally fine and i love the way the dress fell around my body, it had a great feminine look yet was loose and comfy, and the length was great. Worth the price and I would buy again for sure."

6023,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Soft, Comfortable, Great for Running in NYC Use together with Duofold Men's Mid Weight Wicking Crew Neck Top and Bottom, also bought on Amazon, for running in cold NYC winter. The longer I sprint, walk, sprint - HIT - High Interval Training; the hotter it gets. So I flip down the hood, next I take off sweatshirt. After a while, I'm down to a T Shirt and Shorts. Great way to burn calories and increase your metabolism. I learned the hard way, you have to find a good place to hide this stuff. In NYC, you turn around and it's gone."

6064,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect Fit and Comfort My favorite sweatshirts were branded with a company that neither my husband nor I want to associate with any longer. I needed a good replacement that I could use to advertise our own company, with the same comfort as my old favorites. This one was PERFECT for my needs! Not only is it a great fit (covers my butt so I can wear leggings comfortably), but it's super soft and cozy. It also performed great with the heat transfer vinyl I used to customize our logo. The black heather is like a great charcoal color that I LOVE, and it looks great with blue-green holographic vinyl. Will definitely purchase again!"

6086,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Be careful with the size. As I read in the comments, I ordered a size larger than I normally wear. I wish I would have ordered 2. It is extremely light weight and cool. It‚Äôs great for working in the yard. I don‚Äôt work out in the gym but would say to order 2 sizes larger if you like the looser fit."

I have one pair of gymshark camo Print seamless and these are just as nice, material seems slightly thinner but I believe it‚Äôs because these have 12% spandex and the gymshark ones I own have only 8%<br /><br />After reading reviews I bought gray (pictured) in Size small and olive green color in size medium. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and ~140 lbs. Honestly could wear either size but I like that the tighter (size small) feels like there‚Äôs more of a controlled/slimming effect in the stomach area. Highly recommend and will be buying more!"

6121,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"PERFECT HOT SALMON PINK! It runs a bit smaller than some hoodies that are labeled Large, but I‚Äôm fine with that as I‚Äôm losing weight currently anyway. Just maybe something to keep in mind for those that aren‚Äôt. It could also just be my body type.<br /><br />ANYWAYS, as you can see the color of this hoodie is beyond brilliantly STUNNING. Definitely not the orangey color portrayed in the sellers photo. Hot salmon pink is one of my all time favorite colors and I feel like it‚Äôs hard to find in clothing items so I‚Äôm stoked I came across this! It‚Äôs typical hoodie material, so very comfy. I‚Äôll update how the color is affected after washing."

It's so comfortable and I love the green color I ordered. I got an XL because I wanted something really cozy to lounge about in. Hopefully it stays soft for a long time."

6143,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good just a little short I‚Äôm tall, so it‚Äôs just a little short on me. Other than that great."

6145,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great fit! I love these- I use them as under shirts while exercising and they are perfect!
6146,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"So Comfortable I bought several of the short sleeve Popyoung dress and this long sleeve did not disappoint.  It is so comfortable, can not wait for some cooler weather."
6147,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Used for dinner trip to Alaska. Bought these for a trip to Alaska in July. They worked out great. Not to hot. . .I ordered an XL because I wear 38 DDD.
6148,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good quality! This Zip Up hoodie is thick and fit perfectly. It isn‚Äôt too big or small or too think or thick , Just perfect!! I definitely would recommend."
6149,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great sweat shirt for the money. Fits as expected.
6150,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,When I tighten the straps up it fits fine. Very happy other than the funny cut The cut around the top and arms has a lot of material. When I tighten the straps up it fits fine. Very happy other than the funny cut.
6151,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Will order again!! Satisfied
6152,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great shirts I love these for basic tanks. I wear scrubs for work and these are great for undershirts for my scrubs. I also will just wear them for every day. While doing yard work and layering they will ride up and have to keep pulling them down when layered with other clothes, so may not be good for working out."
6153,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great everyday zip up jacket! Fit true to size.  Durable, good quality and not too heavy or light.  Perfect for cooler weather."
6154,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Comfortable.
6155,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect workout tanks!!! The material and fit are great!!! Perfect workout tanks! I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù 148Ibs and ordered a small! Fits perfect!! If you like your tanks/shirts to fit looser than I would size up one.
6156,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good undershirts I ordered XL & usually wear a medium & they fit comfortably.  The material dries quickly.
6157,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Comfortable My back has never looked better.
6158,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great workout shirts Great workout shirts. Decent quality. For slightly loose.
6159,4,B0928FSGGD,1,8/10 I really enjoy these shirts! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 145lbs and order a small because I like a form fitting feel. My only complaint is the logo on the shirt I wish it was either smaller or no logo at all. But still worth it!
6160,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Cute dress! Fits well my daughter loves this dress. Purchased last minute to replace dress that was not arriving on time
6161,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Perfect!
6162,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Try them out! Skin-tight, cooling material.  If you already wear undershirts of a similar style, I highly recommend getting a set of 3 to try out.  I'm on the fence about upgrading / replacing all my hanes ""regular cotton"" undershirts, because these are quite good but definitely have a different feel to them (aren't as warm for one thing).<br /><br />If you're in a hot climate, these work well for around-the-house as well (ie: preventing skin from sticking to a leather couch while watching TV), and they do have a bit of a compression/slimming effect, and because they are made from ""fancy"" material instead of cotton, they don't ""stick"" as much to a cotton/polo shirt on top which can help prevent bumps + wrinkles.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
6163,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,loved it! sweater was super comfy and warm. After washing and drying it there were no lint balls. Sweater didn't  shrink either
6164,5,B09M6X79V9,1,great product great product
6165,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"comfortable, fits big it's a mens sweater so it definitely fits big on a woman, I bought this because I feel a grey hoodie is a staple. it's comfortable, warm, and can be dressed up or down. good quality, but I wish I bought a size small"
6166,5,B09M6X79V9,1,The way it fit Just wish it was a little tighter. It is okay because I'm between sizes.
6167,4,B09M6X79V9,1,A lil snug Fit is good just runs a lil small
6168,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Comfy Very comfortable fit. Will buying a few more for sure.
6169,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nothing at this moment I like it its very comfortable
6170,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great pair of leggings These are amazing leggings but maybe a half size too big. But still love these leggings. I have then in 3 colors
6171,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great shirts, not the best quality These shirts are very nice looking and good value considering the 3-pack and pricing. The quality isn‚Äôt best as one of the tank tops we‚Äôre ripped taking it out of the package."
6172,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"When used as undershirts these shirts Are Very Comfortable after trying multiple brands of quick wicking muscle shirts i decided on these because they look good , fit well, and appear to be a decent quality though I am struggling to keep them Bright!"
6173,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,... for my nephew for Christmas and he is very happy with it I bought this for my nephew for Christmas and he is very happy with it.  Much better quality than what the picture shows.  Heavy and warm!
6174,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,It's nice. My son like the Russell Hooded to wear at work.
6175,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Comfy Great fit, color, stretchiness, fabric, & was easy to wash in cold water."
6176,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good value The fit of this shirt is good. The price was fair and the quality of this shirt is great. No complaints. I recommend this product.
6177,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Item runs a little large on size so I ordered accordingly nad it fits as expected
6178,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Hoody I like it a lot
6179,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Amazing!!!!! Buy right now!!!! Amazing! Every women needs a pair of these!
6180,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Pretty dang good for the price! A bit more snug than I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11, 190ish pounds and I had to get the XXL for it to fit the way I want, which was a bit looser like a true jogger. If you want a snug/yoga pant type fit, I‚Äôd recommend getting your normal size. If you want them to be loose, size up! Material is super soft, feels like yoga pants, not swishy at all. I got the drawstring version of the dark camo and the pictures are spot on. Length is just above the ankle, so not too short but may not be want some folks are looking for.<br /><br />Overall, I will probably get more pairs in the future, now that I know the right size. Let‚Äôs up they are consistent. üò¨"
6181,5,B097RFTKJP,1,So cute! Loved this dress!  The medium fit perfect (my usual size) and I've received many compliments on this dress!  Would love to see this in more colors!
6182,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Comfortable Thought these shirts were supposed to be the Y-back fit as stated in the description. Instead they fit the same as the 3-pk runners type I ordered about a week or so before. Still happy with these. I received three different colors anyhow from the previous set and they fit perfectly. I am about 5‚Äô 4‚Äù  and weigh about 160 lbs. I ordered Size L. Very comfortable and help keep you dry.
6183,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Super flattering I actually love everything about this pair of pants. The material is great and the high waist feels like a control top and flattens my mid-section. The material feels really nice to the skin as well. I get good airflow when I workout in it so it doesn't stick to the skin. I'll probably buy another pair soon.
6184,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Dry fit They fit like they should. I love the dry fit material. I would highly recommended these to anyone that is looking for a shirt to workout in.
6185,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Sweat shirt Bought for my son. The size fits as described. Fits great and washes well. Would definitely buy again.
6186,4,B0928FSGGD,1,I love the way the material feels and looks. I like that I sweat less in this top. I don't like to sweat.
6187,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect Perfect
6188,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great product üëçüèª
6189,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Fits really well! Love all the colors These are soo good!! Read a lot of reviews for size to get a nice fit and they really helped. I bought size S(small). My height is 5.5‚Äù and weight 126 lbs. All three colours (blue, neon, red) are amazing. Better than what I expected. Good deal for the price. Good for workout as well as casual wear:)"
6190,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"These work great, and the best part is they're very light ... I don't use these shirts as compression shirts, I use them because I needed something snug fitting for when I run to prevent chaffing. These work great, and the best part is they're very light and thin, so when I wear my running shirt over them, I don't get too hot. I also like that they're moisture wicking because I tend to sweat a lot."
6191,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Perfect jogger! You can dress these up or dress them down & they are perfect. The fit is amazing & comfy. Material is not cotton but more of a slick sort of feel, doesn‚Äôt detract from the item though. I ordered in black & will be reordering other colors!"
6192,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good Sweatshirt Good sweatshirt and value. Does run a little large but that is ok.
6193,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great Dress and great deal! This dress is fantastic! It is flattering, comfortable and can be dressed up or down. I ordered a Medium and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt size down. The dress is very billowy and loose but the chest area was just right. I would choose the size based on the chest size.<br /><br />Delivery was quick and I will consider buying other colors!"
6194,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great Fit & Squat Proof SO SO COMFY! Love wearing this around all day and at the gym.
6195,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars It was very good
6196,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Easy to throw on Easy to throw on. Very cute. It is very thin fabric thus a little see through. Perfect for the beach or pool.
6197,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Always comfy Russell brand has always been well known and well made in my opinion. Lasts a long time if you treat it right, which is easy! Cuz it‚Äôs machine washable and doesn‚Äôt warp or shrink or anything with wear and washings. It fits well, so order your usual! This brand is one that has big and large sizes. Like large large! I recommend!"
6198,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Nice and warm
6199,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"and love the pocket feature Very cute, and love the pocket feature. I am just looking for accessories to wear over this, but I love the dress!"
6200,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"This was as described Very cute cardigan, does run a tad large"
6201,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"females order a size or 2 down depending how you like them to fit. I‚Äôm a basic hoodie and leggings kind of person and ever since I got this one, all of my other hoodies just hang in the closet. This is my go to, my absolute favorite, most comfy hoodie. Keeps me warm, and the insides are very soft. I first ordered it in a size 2XL, usual cotton hoodies I wear a 2XL to be comfy and Incase of shinkage, but I literally was drowning in this one, I returned and got a size XL and fits a just little baggy but not too tight, which is exactly how I like it. Doesn‚Äôt shrink very much in the washer like the others causing it to ride up on me all the time, so that‚Äôs a major plus! Got 2 on sale for Black Friday for only $30 bucks! One in black which I gave to my friend (which he loves) and one in the grey which looks very nice.  If they were just a little bit cheaper I would definitely be buying way more of them!! Love this hoodie soo much!"
6202,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Great quality thank you
6203,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Comfy cozy butter yellow Soft and such a beautiful yellow, like butter."
6204,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Yes yes yes I‚Äôm always skeptical about buying clothes online but after reading the reviews I figured I would give it a shot. I was not disappointed!! They are so soft and stretchy which allows me to move freely when exercising. I plan on buying more in the future for sure! I ordered a size M and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 158 lbs and they fit perfectly.
6205,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars loved it
6206,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great Fit and Length Perfect for wearing underneath another shirt in the cooler months and will be perfect alone for summer.  I like that they are a little longer and they do not ride up!  Love them!
6207,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice sweatshirt Nice comfortable sweatshirt.  Use around the house and keeps me warm
6208,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"great for layering Thin but warm, liked the compression fit to keep out the wind. Not bulky for packing."
6209,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Just what I expected So far I like the fleece crew, but haven't had it long enough to see how its washes and stains, I seems to have trouble with white fleece staining easily so am waiting to see"
6210,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Soft and comfortable.  A little baggy. Even the medium is a little baggy for me (compared to most medium tops).  But it is super soft and comfy.
6211,5,B076QD9NP1,1,very nice dress. My little girl loved it.  thanks
6212,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,GREAT This is super flattering on your butt and it actually does pretty well when working out. Also squat proof which is a plus
6213,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Every day Wear!! I wear one of these style shirts everyday. Way better than the A type (wife beater) shirts! I have always wore an undershirt since I can remember. Probably passed 20 years or so. Since finding these, only under shirts I wear now!! Highly recommended!!! Very comfortable"
6214,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Just Perfect! Great product, I'm very satisfied"
6215,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"nice color red Well made, nice color red.  Washes well.  Highly recommend."

6218,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Was so happy to find this brand my son in law loves them
6219,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Everything is perfect but the waistband. The quality is great but like other reviewers have mentioned if you carry any weight around your lower abdomen these aren‚Äôt very flattering, the band is much shorter than other leggings I own and pushes any extra skin above and below the band. I<br /><br />The wait band does not flatter me well. Not sure if sizing up from a medium (what I ordered and normally order for leggings) to a large would fix this issue as they fit nicely everywhere else. I‚Äôm also very short and these are oddly sized in some places but I don‚Äôt blame that on anything but me being too small.<br /><br />I have no complaints on quality or price but I did wish these fit and flattered me a bit better."
6220,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell makes great hoodies Always buy Russell when I want a hoodie. Very Comfortable...

6239,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,All in One Legging I love the style and comfort of these leggings.  The fact that they are seamless is one less ‚Äúitch‚Äù to worry about.  They hug and move with your bodies moves.  They also wash and retain their shape.  I would recommend these to my friends!
6240,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"This size was a little smaller than expected. Loved the color, but it fit a little tighter than I would have liked it to fit."
6241,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Not squat proof Right on the package it stated that it's not squat proof. It feels like an okay type of material. I'll update when I wear for one of my work outs.

6248,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great buy! Love these have ordered two sets. Comfortable for hot weather. Workout or wear out to back yard BBQ.
6249,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I absolutely love the look of this dress I absolutely love the look of this dress...with a shirt or jacket!  Unfortunately, I have to wear a shirt or a jacket because this is a really &#34;boxy&#34; fitted dress.  The top of the dress bows out at the breast/armpit area.  I put it as fit as expected and really FTS, but in reality it fits everywhere except the breast area which is super tight, and then REALLY loose under the armpit.  I can cover it with a shirt or jacket easily."
6250,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars this product wears down quickly after 3-4 washes and begins to pill. Lower quality cotton.

6256,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Buy your normal size I'm 5'3"", 120 lbs, small chested and I bought the small, it's a bit more tight than I prefer, I should have bout medium. I wear both small/medium but I still wear them to workout. The material is nice and soft against the skin, colors are very saturated and beautiful. I will probably get more colors, just size up. A great find!"

6262,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"My fave summer dress! Love this dress!! I received so many complements. Super comfortable and very flattering. I am very short, which is why I scored the fit as I did.  I just used some no sew tape on the bottom to adjust the length and it's perfect."

6269,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"More modern fit.  Smaller than previous renditions I bought this full Russel sweatsuit for father's day to replace the same one he's had for years.  I bought the same size he had previously and it came a little smaller than the previous one.  Sweatpants had a narrower leg, a more modern fit."
6270,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Look at fit great!  The sizing is consistent with US sizing. I'm 5'4"" 120 pounds and have a 26"" waist.  I purchased size XS.  These fit great for both the gym and for a very fitted undershirt.  I liked them so much I bought a second 3 pack of them."
6271,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy. Very comfortable and worth the money.
6272,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"The Only Workout Leggings I'll Buy from Amazon These are seriously the only leggings I'll buy from amazon. Being the type who doesn't like to spend $50 on one pair of leggings, I am quite the coinsurer of amazon workout leggings. I've bought at least 30 different pairs, and have returned 90% of them due to the way they look, sheerness, or falling apart. These are the ONLY ones that are flattering, squat proof, AND durable. I lift heavy on leg day, and these are completely durable for the occasion. If you lift heavy, these are the only leggings I recommend buying on amazon."
6273,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Great deal the medium is a little to snug for me Great deal. Little to snug for me, but I‚Äôm accepting it.  I would order a large if I could do this again. I am only 110lbs"

6276,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love it! Oh I love everything about this dress. Its length and the feel of the material... very nice!!!
6277,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Length is too short I like the quality of these joggers. I can‚Äôt compare to any high end brands, but they feel nice and the waistband is sturdy. I am 5‚Äô3 and 125 lbs and I got size Medium. They fit perfectly.<br /><br />The only cons with these joggers are the length. I am 5‚Äô3 and they come just above my ankle. I wish they were longer. I‚Äôm short, so this won‚Äôt work well for anyone taller than me."
6278,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,If Your Normally A Size M I would suggest to go up a Size If fit just right
6279,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Russell makes a quality sweatshirt and the large always fits.
6280,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Comfortable I love how warm they are and how b comfortable they are. I recommend 100%
6281,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Bought for exercise but wear them for everything I would give this 6 stars if I could.  I bought these for workout shirts but with winter coming I'm also wearing them under everything to layer up.  Now that I'm using them all the time I don't have enough and need to order more.  They are so comfortable, have the right amount of stretch, they are the perfect length for me and they are thin and comfortable plus even the pink tank was not really see through using a black bra.  I'm 5'8&#34;, 150 lbs, small chested and I ordered the US M. This is not a biased review, I paid full price."
6282,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Casual but nice Very casual. Thinner material than I expected but not see through. Sized down and it fit well. I think it would be easily dressed up with a moto jacket and jewelry.
6283,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits good and wears well No issues.  Fits good and wears well.
6284,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"A great tank! Love love love.  Keeps you lifted, snug but not like a sausage, great every day tank.  Buying another set of three next paycheck.  A definite must have for the essentials.  Fabric feels good, very comfortable.  A bit of stretch in all the right places."
6285,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,New favorite leggings! These are my new favorite workout leggings! I am 5‚Äô3 so they go a little high on me in the torso region but the legs are perfect. I love that this is also anti camel toe and they do not slip when I go on a run or when I‚Äôm doing high intensity workouts. The waist also sucks you in and gives an hour glass shape. Only thing is that since it goes high on my torso that when I do ab workouts it tends to roll down.
6286,5,B09M6X79V9,1,It does the job It was exactly what I was looking for.<br />I needed a replacement for my undershirt that has been discontinued and this is exactly what I wanted
6287,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Perfect fit and weight for the gym I liked the fit of this tank and the weight is great for hot Houston weather, the hood is just for a cool look. Would buy more."
6288,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Cant beat the price on these clothes. Finally found some affordable clothing with out the high name brand price. I am transitioning my sizes to a smaller size. Been difficult locating clothing that is not over priced. Was able to buy these hooded shorts & 2 pairs of shorts for about $50. Well worth it. Just ordered 2 more sets.
6289,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Comfortable but shorter than expected based on pictures Wore to an outdoor casual wedding. Very comfortable. Was Larger fit then thought it was going to be. Also was a bit shorter hem line then I like but worked ok with leggings/ tights and boots.
6290,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars :)
6291,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Good but one issue Really nice color and fit but giving me very much camel toe üòÇ
6292,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Would buy again Fits great, great when working out in cooler months"
6293,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great Item Item is great quality just like the picture the only thing is it runs a bit big. I would size down. 140lbs 5‚Äô1 I ordered a size Medium and wished I ordered a size small.
6294,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Just what I was looking for! This is the first review I have ever written. But I love these shirts so much--great purchase!!! I wanted long sleeved shirts to go under my scrubs. Wanted them tight fitting so they wouldn't bunch or twist. I love them! In fact, I ordered 3 more. I am 5'6 and weigh 148 lbs.  I normally wear a medium or large when it comes to shirts. I ordered a large and I love how they fit. They are snug, not super tight. I have worn underarmour brand before and these are every bit as good with a better price tag. They wash well and don't shrink. I even put them in the dryer. They are flattering with the black stitching (but of course it's covered up by my scrubs). I highly recommend this purchase."
6295,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Dad loved so much he bought 2 more! Dad loved it so much he bought 2 more
6296,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Just What I Needed! If you‚Äôre super indecisive about choosing between buying similar products on Amazon then just stop. I promise you this is the item you‚Äôre looking for. I bought mine and just got it today; the shirts fit perfectly and show off the back enough that it looks good but so that it also is comfortable. The material is breathable and not see through, I‚Äôm not sure why some shoppers said it was? Bottom line this is like less than $8 per shirt that would normally cost like $20-15 for just one individual shirt in the physical store suck as Dicks.<br /><br />I bought size small and I am 5‚Äô9‚Äô‚Äô and weigh around 160 pounds. It fits well and isn‚Äôt too long. Be careful with the XS though, it might construct you in the armpits unless you actually need xs.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt give out very many five star reviews or ever feel compelled to write these PERIOD. However, I knew I had to when these literally blew my mind after I got them in the mail!<br /><br />Good job Neleus!"
6297,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Product Love it! Super comfortable and warm!
6298,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,It was quite the delight. The sweatshirt was comfortable and was perfect to ... It was quite the delight. The sweatshirt was comfortable and was perfect to get me sweating. Wasn't too warm and looks amazing. 6/9 ducks would recommend. Was bit too large
6299,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,A future quilted cardigan I am using it to make a quilted cardigan and it is of proper weight and meetings all my specifications
6300,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"comfortable and breathable I really liked these shirts as an extra layer during the polar vortex that hits IL  in winter and the spring chills! These compression shirts did not ride up or snag easily as others I've tried have. In fact, they actually were long enough to cover my slight muffin top and thighs AND DID NOT ONCE (!!!!) RIDE UP MY BACK DURING AN 9 HOUR SHIFT AT WORK!!!! Loved it as I do a lot of bending, twisting, lifting, etc working retail. I will be adding more to my clothing repertoire in the near future (just wish more colors).<br /> The only thing I would caution is that you need to order a size larger than what you normally would even when it says 'true to size'.  I've used that piece of advice with almost all my clothes and it works (only with shoes/boots does the true to fit actually work)."
6301,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Met my expectations Product met my expectations
6302,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Love these pants These are super comfortable & cute.  Not your average sweat pant.  These actually make your back side look good!  When wearing you don‚Äôt feel like a slouch.  Put some white tennis shoes on cute tee & jacket,  and you‚Äôre good to go."
6303,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Buy Awesome for price
6304,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"In love with it! üòç A MUST HAVE! [[VIDEOID:82532bd79ad85eb4e3c858d693a26733]] I‚Äôm a personal trainer so I can right away tell if this is a hit or miss! BIG HIT! It‚Äôs not see through, it shapes you well, fits as expected.<br />I‚Äôm about 118lbs, 5-5, usually wearing XS or S.<br />The feel on the skin is great and the ombr√© effect is awesome! Bf loves it! I wish they had more colors in ombr√© though‚Ä¶ A MUST HAVE!"

They are very sexy and make you look pretty hot and ripped.<br /><br />I am 5'11, 41 chest, 38 waist, broad shoulders, 15"" arms, and I got a medium. It's very 'fitted' on me but by no means 'tight' or small."

6308,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Wear to work out, run errands, as an u see tank or lounging. I love these tanks. But sad to mention my sleeve part had fallen apart. The stitch where you put your arm in has separated. Instead of 3 I‚Äôm down to two. Still love em"

6316,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Excellent product! Length/compression/quality....<br />Been through the wash & dry...no problems. Will not be going back to regular cotton. These are amazing. Under dress shirts/t shirts/active wear...it just works! 6'4. 330ish...I'm in the gym 4-5 days a week...I'm built like a fridge not an egg. It's not a girdle. But it gives you a tight body feeling & smoothing effect.

I bought a medium based on another review of the black drawstring joggers. I wanted these to fit slightly loose without clinging to my butt or being too baggy and these are perfect. They are a stretchy athletic feel and are not noisy at all. They are very smooth and comfortable and would do well for everyday wear. I highly recommend them!"
6320,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,A must have for Fall I love this! I‚Äôll be wearing it all Fall/Winter! It‚Äôs lightweight and stylish and fit as expected.

6332,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"GREAT fit I love these leggings, I bought a pair of grey and the red-wine colors. I workout a bunch so I wanted to get cheap but quality leggings and these are awesome! the only complaint is that when you're doing a lot of cardio that involves burpees, jumping up and down from floor activity to regular activity (like a HIIT workout), the band rolls a bit at the top. Otherwise, for leg/arm days, or everyday wear, it doesn't roll much!"
6333,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great dress, love everything about it! I love the fabric, the fit, the style. Lovely, cant wait to wear it out and about, to the beach , at home , or out with friends, or date nite with hubby."

My daughter is tall for her age... Would have ordered the pants to go with it (since it's more of a skater skirt length with her height.). She currently wears leggings with it... Would recommend Jxstar matching leggings ... Would be adorable together. That will be my next purchase.
6335,5,B09M6X79V9,1,‚ô•Ô∏è These Love these tank tops. I ordered a Large as typical tank tops run small. Will prob reorder in a Medium. There‚Äôs no built in bra which I like.

6348,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"New favorite tank! My new favorite workout tank! I‚Äôm always looking for high neck tanks so I don‚Äôt have to worry about mishaps during pushups, burpees, or down dog and this fits the bill! It‚Äôs a light material without being see through. The large arm holes make it flowy and keeps you cool. I typically wear a M/L depending on the brand. I have both a medium and a large and prefer the medium‚Äôs fit. I‚Äôm a 36D and 10-12 pants for comparison."
6349,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Product The Russell athletic sweat shirts are the best
6350,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"super comfortable This pullover fits very comfortably.  Warm, but a little bit too light for cold windy days. The wind seems to cut through it a bit too much. That said, it is still becoming one of my favorite go to light weight pullovers."

Must Have in Every Color The vivid colors... the light and breezy fabric.... the deep pockets... the adjustable straps.... 100% perfection! Must have in every color, I don't wanna take this bundle of happiness off! I'm 145 lbs/5""5 tall and a small fits loose and flowy and hangs exceptionally well. Can jazz it up or keep it casual, adding a cardigan or a cropped leather jacket or even a jean jacket will make it transition into fall really well. The fabric is light but more on the opaque side, my man walked behind me and promised me he couldn't see my undies. I'll have to trust him on that. But overall, I really love this dress!"

It's very flattering very flowy and so glad that it's beautiful. It's not sheer at all so you can't see through it but the stretch is amazing and very forgiving I just pair it with a pair of good leggings ankle boots or even dress shoes and I'm good to go. I got it in two different colors a black and a camouflage and can honestly say I will definitely buy it in more colors. Will definitely recommend to other family and friends as well.
6406,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Vivid colors This is my absolute favorite hoodie. The colors are vivid and fit remains perfect-even after maaaany washes. I get tons of compliments anytime I wear it. I actually have to re-purchase soon because my girlfriend has claimed it as her own. üòÇ

It is perfect the color was just as expected, it came on time, like new, very soft and I'm excited to be warm tomorrow in my paf hoodie!!"

6424,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Love these Gymshark Dupes! I love these leggings! The fit perfect in all the right spots. These are VERY flattering! For reference, I am 5‚Äô5 155lbs and am a size 6 in jeans. I was able to fit into a small since there is a bit of stretch to them! Definitely will be buying more colors!"
6425,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I‚Äôd buy every color Everything about these shirts are awesome! I wish i could find this shirt without the logo.
6426,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Super Comfy Dress! I'm petite 5'1&#34; busty...fits great! Great length for me, (not too long) which is always a problem for me. Will buy in another color!!"

6430,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Comfy, warm, accentuates curves nicely I was surprised by these leggings. The feel of the pants are nice. They go up on my waist and don‚Äôt feel tight. They make my bottom look nice üò¨ I really enjoyed wearing them they were comfortable.<br />Im thick, 5‚Äô3 162 lbs, thick thighs, thick bottom. I normally wear a medium and I purchased a medium and they fit just right.<br />That all being said I haven‚Äôt worn them for a workout, so I can‚Äôt speak for how they hold up during the workout. Either way, they‚Äôre nice leggings to have for lounging or casually going out."
6431,5,B07XD71F1H,1,It‚Äôs a perfect dress for any occasion Dress it up or wear it casual. I love it very comfortable and had lots of complments
6432,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Awesome Love these got them as underscrubs.
6433,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,IT'S OK. Good hoodie it just makes those annoying lint balls but nothing a lint diffuser can't do !
6434,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love this dress Fits comfortably, washes well and is flattering"
6435,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great for the Price Went with the Medium as I am 5'3&#34; 138 and a 34D.  They fit as expected.  They quality is really nice.  Plan on these to hold up for quite some time.  I do suggest washing them first there is a slight smell when first received.  That is due to the material and being packaged in a plastic bag.
6436,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,True to size. True to size. Looks great.
6437,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Very Comfortable Like the product very sleek

6439,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Good quality and low price I really like these long sleeves, they are good quality, fit well, flattering, and overall get the job done! I wear these for volleyball practice and conditioning and I highly recommend this fabric for working on diving. I like how this seller offers a wide range of colors and options. For an even more flattering look I‚Äôd recommend the v-neck but that‚Äôs my opinion, both are the same material and quality!"
6440,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,‚ô•Ô∏èFavorite go to pants These are great especially for the price. My new favorite.
6441,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Amazing, good quality and flattering Finally really soft good fitting joggers. They are not see-through. Great material. Not super loose, more like loose fitting leggings. They don't look like pajama pants like most joggers. Thick thigh and mommy pouch approved!  I eventually will buy more colors."
6442,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,great purchase like quality of the fabric
6443,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Excellent quality for the price These tanks are excellent to wear during my intense workouts. They fit well and look flattering. Great quality for the price!
6444,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Just as shown Its just so beautiful
6445,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great color, and awesome dress! I got the red with white polka dots, and my husband's eyes lit up when I tried it on.  It's very flattering, nice and roomy and cool.  Good weight to the fabric, but not at all thick.  I""m 5' 4"", so it hits the floor, but with a pair of heels, it'll be fine.  I'm glad I got this dress."
6446,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Amazing Amazing and comfortable, kept me fresh in the sun and was comfortable around my whole body and very stretchy."
6447,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Perfect compression These leggings fit just as I had hoped. Just the right amount of compression throughout the legs and I love the compression in the high waist tummy area. The green is completely squat proof. These are a great alternative to the more expensive name brand leggings.
6448,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice Nice
6449,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I Like. I wear a 3XL Big, and this shirt is just right,warm, very comfortable on my bare skin. will buy again."
6450,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Fit was perfect. Wore the dress for a wedding.  Do wish it fastened at the back of the neck instead of at the side
6451,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Mens hooded jacket Product is just right
6452,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"A must have just because These Tanks are perfect for working out, or just every day wear. The material is so soft. It fits firm and really does the job keeping you dry. I definitely love the colors."
6453,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great sweatshirt Great sweatshirt for work and out and about.
6454,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice looking athletic tops Washes well
6455,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Extremely happy with my item. Would definitely recommend.
6456,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Expect to be Satisfied The shirt is exactly as advertised: good quality (but not great) and cheap. Exactly what I was looking for. Do not expect the quality of a $50 hoodie from this but expect to be satisfied.
6457,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,These are just like gym shark vital seamless leggings If someone told me these were gymsharks vital seamless leggings I would believe them. They are squat proof! Can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs sweat proof but I really break a sweat in the gym and still wear them all the time. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 160lbs and large fits perfect
6458,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Sweatshirt I live in this sweatshirt. Great for a fall day or a chilly restaurant. I keep it in my car for whenever I need it.
6459,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love! Perfect size and fit.  Came on time.
6460,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great product! I really liked how these pants fit! at first I was a little worried but they fit just how i wanted! not too tight and not to loose. It also feels like a dryfit material which makes it great for working out!
6461,5,B009R09Z8W,1,üëç üëç
6462,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Fits and looks great. Fits and looks great.
6463,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Daughters favorite dress My daughter LOVES this dress .... just bought three more with different prints
6464,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweat shirt Fits great. No problems.
6465,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Little bit small but okay Good
6466,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"I‚Äôm very happy with my results and bought them in 3 different colors I am a medium so I bought small and it was ok but then I bought xtra small and that did the job if you have a problem with your stomach and side bulging then xsmall will tuck everything in just fine, but be aware that you are compressing your diaphragm so if your working out or doing hard work it may not be a good idea to use them under those circumstances, I‚Äôm very happy with my results and bought them in 3 different colors"
6467,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Try it on before making decision! When I initially took the shirts out of the package I felt disappointed, thinking they looked small. I decided to throw them in the washer and dryer anyway. Everything changed when I put one on. These shirts are like a second skin. Fits great and I love them for layering. For reference my weight is about 135. I purchased size medium. Perfect length in both the torso and arms. Chilly today so I layered one of my favorite tees over the black shirt and it is very comfortable."
6468,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Excellent shirts Great shirts, cool, fit well, and look great. Would order again."
6469,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very warm. I bought it for work and it's really comfy and warm.
6470,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"IN LOVE I am a size 12, and I ordered these in a Large.  IN LOVE.  Will probably order all the colors!!  Love the style of the waistband, and how flattering they are.  Look no further ladies, these are amazing!!"
6471,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Fit perfectly Exactly what I was hoping for. Very comfortable
6472,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Ridiculously comfortable! Very nice material. Fabric has some weight to it like good jersey. Flattering and extremely comfortable.
6473,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good active compression shirts They are of good quality but fit a little snugger than I would have liked.  Overall it's a good shirt.  I am not sure if they are moisture wicking or have sun protection though.
6474,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Really great tops for working out Really great tops for working out.. I didn't like them at first because they felt a little stiff but after washing they have been great.
6475,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,BEST Leggings I've Ever Worn I'm now convinced these are literally THE leggings to own! I was skeptical even with all the positive reviews but they're legit & the most flattering leggings I've ever put on my body! I'll definitely be buying more colors soon. Haven't worked out in them yet so I can't say yet how they'll work for that but they literally feel like you're wearing nothing!!
6476,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Great product I love love love this shirt! I bought it in 5 different colors. It is loose when lifting heavy and it‚Äôs super comfortable!
6477,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Worth the money! I was able to purchase when they were about $8 a shirt and it was an absolute steal. I think they are perfect for going to the gym or playing basketball in. I‚Äôve never wore a shirt like this before so it was an adjustment getting used to the back. I would have gave them 5 stars but the material reminds me of a cheap basketball practice jersey instead of a normal T-shirt. Otherwise, an exceptional buy."
6478,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect! Perfect. Washed well.
6479,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Loved the dress- My daughter loved her dress. She wears a 7/8 and I ordered a 7/8 and it fit nice but she could have went bigger
6480,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Quality color sz. My grandson loved it since it was his high school color and fit perfect.
6481,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Lightweight tank tops at a bargain price! Packaging:<br />All 3 shirts were packed in a ‚Äúzip lock‚Äù style bag, which is good since it has been raining here as of late! They were packed into a shipping envelope and the shipping was fast!<br />Product:<br />The shirt fit a little big but for me, that is how I like my clothes to fit, a little loose. I ordered 2XL since I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2, 265 lbs. I really like these shirts for the shoulder blade cut and also for the length. These shirts are very lightweight and porous. I will be ordering them again!"
6482,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Fun cute dress What a fun cute dress. Daughter loves it.
6483,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Five Stars great material, able to work out get a good compacted sweat"
6484,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"great quailty super comfortable, heavy duty, great for cozy winter nights."
6485,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great Dupe for Gymshark Leggings I love these leggings for the price point! Have multiple colors in both medium and large. Always look great, wash well and I just hang dry! Will continue to buy more colors! Not see through and I am on the rounder side!"
6486,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Satisfied These were a gift and she was very pleased with them.<br />Squat-proof as advertised and better quality than a high end brand available on ‚Äúinternet only‚Äù type site.<br />Will be a returning customer.
6487,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Looks great Liked
6488,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love these! These leggings are some of the best gym leggings I've had! They are super comfy and they look really great on me! I like the ombre design and the compression isn't too much that it is uncomfortable but they stay up during workouts. I can't wait to buy more of these!
6489,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Great dress! Love it. Runs small. Bought size L. 135 lbs. 5-4. Fit snug.
6490,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Colors are great and great price I wanted something snug so I ordered small and it is small/snug and for a petite person. I'm 5&#34;3' / 120lb. Colors are great and great price, too."
6491,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Super nice! Saw a review buy 2 sizes bigger and I did. I'm a Xlg usually got a 2xl perfect fit. I love these I'm going to get another pair. I'd wash on cold to not shrink.
6492,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great product but runs big I have always liked Russel products and this is no exception. The one thing I would say is buy a size down from what you wear in other brands. For example I wear a large Nike hoodie but had to return the large Russel hoodie and get a medium. I am 5'9&#34; 185 lbs.
6493,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Excellent! Tall girl approved! So mad at myself for not ordering sooner. I‚Äôve been eyeing these for a while but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù with a 36/37‚Äù inseam and assumed they‚Äôd be too short or fit weird. NOPE! They‚Äôre perfect. They come to my ankle because of the stretch. They‚Äôre soft, and soooo comfy. Girls let‚Äôs be real, I don‚Äôt have perfect thighs and you can not see my lumps and bumps, just the right amount of compression to not be uncomfortable but hold in the mom tummy. I purchased a medium like I do for other brands and it‚Äôs just right. Get these, just do it."
6494,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Worth every penny. Very good quality product. I ordered medium and the fit was perfect.
6495,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Cute quality dress! Cute dress, daughter loved it for July 4th!"
6496,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,My boyfriend loves them He loves working out in these. Fit great and are light and breathable.
6497,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great product Great product
6498,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Ordered Large for me I read the reviews before ordering and I‚Äôm glad I did.  I am 6‚Äô 4‚Äù, 190 lbs. and have a 34‚Äù sleeve.  I usually buy extra large to give me more room.  I listened to the reviews and bought three sweat shirts size LARGE. All three fit perfectly and I am very happy with the quality of the Russell Product.<br />I also belong to PRIME and the two day shipping free was a nice bonus."
6499,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Perfect gift for boyfriend and awesome price My boyfriend works out a lot and loves sleeveless shirts wasn't sure how he'd feel about the Jersey like material but loved it I ordered a large and fit as expected like all his other shirts
6500,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Runs small Nice quality, just glad I ordered a large instead of my normal medium because they run small."
6501,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Excellent sweatshirt Male, 6'8"", 230 lbs. ordered 2xl.  Fits great, well made, looks good, feels good, good price, got here quick.  Good value, nice buy."
6502,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good hood! This thing is awesome. Super comfortable.
6503,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Nice sweats! Seemed like they had already been worn.  No tags and had some pilling.  But very comfy!
6504,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not compression but comfy and functional I really like the fit of the tank. It‚Äôs comfy, stretchy, and fits perfectly as a layering tank. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a compression tank though. I don‚Äôt feel any compression wearing it."
6505,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Solid! Stats: 160lbs, 5'9'', 42'' chest circ - Got medium size.<br /><br />The fabric feels nice, the chest fits perfectly, and the length is ok. The length fills off but it isn't the length, it is actually the circumference of the waist/bellow chest. It is a little ""square"" rather than ""V shapped,"" which would be preferable. The white one is a little see-through, but not too much (just FYI).<br /><br />I think I could have gotten away with the small, since I am 10lbs over usual weight (always seating in the 145-152lbs lean). I might try their small ones for other models. I got three of this model and three without the hoodie and I don't regret it. Loved it! Great product for the price (paid about $50 for 6 shirts atm)!"
6506,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great dress! This dress is very cute on! Very comfy and flowy - perfect summer maxi that you can dress up or down
6507,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Best joggers on the internet These are literally the most comfortable joggers I have ever bought. 100% a match with the lululemons. Perfect for exercise or going out. I wore these on a run and they were so breathable and perfect for any weather. I‚Äôm usually an XS in the waist but larger in the butt and thighs so I got a S and it fit perfect. I am 4‚Äô11 and they are perfect length on me so if you‚Äôre tall they may be short.
6508,5,B07XD71F1H,1,nice dress My wife needed a dress for our holiday party and we found this one on here. It fit perfectly and was made form a thinner material so it kept her cool.
6509,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Niccce Very breathable with sleek design will be purchasing more clothing
6510,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Super soft and comfy!!! These are very comfortable and look very nice on. Fit as expected. Very soft material.
6511,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Great fabric! Si confortable
6512,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Runs very large I'm a 5'8&#34; athletic built female and I was swimming in the size medium. My 6'3&#34; 200 lb husband could have worn it, but the body was a touch too small. That said the quality is great. It was a nice thick substantial sweatshirt."
6513,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Pretty and easy Bought it in red and then had to order the black as well. Very happy. It shipped super fast and better quality for the price than I thought.
6514,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very nice My husband loved this jacket.
6515,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love love this dress Love love this dress. I wear a size 12-14 and ordered a large. Fits beautifully, love the adjustable shoulder straps. I wear a 40c bra and have plenty of room. The material is lightweight and flows beautifully. I couldn't be more happy only wish the seller had more choices."
6516,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Boyfriend loves it My boyfriend has a few of these types of sweatshirts with the stitched triangle at the neck from American Eagle. Since I have banned him from continuing to shop there (he isn't 16 anymore) he has been on the hunt for no logo sweatshirts like these. I love that there are tons of colors available, what I don't love is how the seller does not provide a size chart. Luckily, there are some lovely reviewers who gave me a heads up about these running large, and I bought my boyfriend a size large as opposed to his normal XL he wears. He tried it on and it fits great. It's summer time so he won't be wearing it regularly for another month or two, but I know he is looking forward to getting more in different colors."
6517,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great shirt! I wanted a large-fitting sweatshirt to wear as a dress and this came exactly how I needed it.
6518,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,nice tights i loved it!
6519,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice! Nice hoody fits perfect and it's really warm.
6520,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Very thin Very thin but comfortable
6521,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Very nice I bought this for my wife and she loves it, it's big and soft. So far it is holding up well, it has been washed quite a bit because we have animals and it has not lost its shape or shrunk any. If there is a change in the near future I will update."
6522,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice!!! This is a very nice sweatshirt! Heavyweight, nice seaming detail and attractive enough to wear ‚Äúout‚Äù. My 20 yr old son is happy with it."
6523,4,B076QD9NP1,1,Size Not to strechy

6549,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Perfect for summer lounging I bought this dress to lounge in, but it looks so good it could be worn for a dinner date.  I bought a small, as I wear a size 4.  My only complaint is it bulges out at the lower hip area.  I‚Äôll have to have it altered.  Otherwise, I love the fit and softness of the fabric."
6550,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,So comfy and great for working out. Flattering too These leggings are super flattering and comfy for working out in. I just purchased my third pair I like them that much. Super comfy and high waist band and minimal chance of camel toe. üòÇ

6552,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Super comfy! I wear this all the time.  Super comfy!  Especially in the winter after the gym this sweatshirt is a lifesaver.

6557,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Super comfy I absolutely love these! They do great at compressing everything but it‚Äôs not that too tight I can‚Äôt breath, it‚Äôs got the right enough stretch to them. Just a little tip they are sheer but they feel amazing!"

6562,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,True to size and description Super sweat wicking and not too hot. I live in Florida and I‚Äôm able to go for runs in these and stay cool (as possible) while protecting my skin from the sun. And fit great too! I‚Äôm a xs/s and a small fit perfectly
6563,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Consistent Quality! Great quality and consistent fit. Delivery was fast!
6564,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Too big if you are petite I am petite, 5‚Äô1 and 115lbs.  I bought the small pack to wear under my scrubs in the winter.  They are baggy in the arms and are super long.  You might want to skip these if you are petite as well."
6565,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Joe's USA Has a New Customer I have worn Carhartt hoodies for years, but I decided to look for something a little less expensive. I had my doubts about this product. To get a hoodie for a guy my size under $30 has always been impossible. When this arrived I tried it on and it fit great. Then I washed it and figured it would shrink and then it would be game over. Well, it didn't shrink. It is lighter than a Carhartt, which is fine for me, and overall I am very satisfied with this hoodie. I have purchased two of them and I will be getting more."
6566,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Quality for the $ I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù - 190 to 195 pounds<br /><br />Medium is just a tad too small for me. I‚Äôve worn these tanks 6 days a week for a solid year and they‚Äôre still kicking and haven‚Äôt taken on stink like some polyester stuff will.<br /><br />Buying again in large. Photos with green shorts are the large, which is better for for my size."
6567,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Great find.. best sweatshirt ever. Love this sweatshirt. I bought it for my son for Christmas!! Going to get one for myself. True to size, no shrinking, no fading. This sweatshirt is super soft. Just like they used to make them before everything became tight fitting and polyester. You won‚Äôt find a sweatshirt like this in your local store."

6574,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Will be buying another one. Shows more skin on the sides than I thought under the bra but still modest. High neck so doesn‚Äôt look revealing. Slimming fit and good cut. I‚Äôm 5,7 150 lbs and wide hips. Medium fit great."
6575,5,B009R09Z8W,1,It is a wonderful asset to my wardrobe for sure. I love the product I wear it lots I use it when going to store and love being able to put wallet and phone in my pouch not having to carry a purse everywhere.  It is very helpful.

6578,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars really soft and roomy
6579,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice quality This sweatshirt is unlike so many that are  not shaped at all, they are like wearing a box.  This one is shaped, it is smaller in the waist than the chest.  The fabric is quality and feels like a sweat shirt should feel.  It keeps it shape when washed and is well worth a couple dollars more than the other ones."
6580,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I‚Äôll buy more for sure They don‚Äôt cling or hold in stank. Stick with these if you‚Äôre thinking about getting the cheaper ones.

6588,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great dupe Perfect length and fit. It does roll when you sit down but not too bad. Also, SQUAT PROOF!"
6589,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Fantastic dupes for Lululemon These are so incredibly comfy but still light weight. I bought them pre pregnancy and they fit well and even at 8 months they still feel pretty good. The stretch is so fantastic.
6590,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Cozy Amazing material and is definitely comfortable!  My only problem is that it runs a little too big.
6591,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Gym or Casual tank is Versatile I was impressed with these tanks. I can wear them to the gym or with jean shorts. The material is lightweight and does not have a high sheen to them. I would re-purchase and recommend.
6592,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Cost effective tanks I hate spending big money for Under Armour when I don't have to. They make great stuff but it's hard to have any variety in your gym attire buying that or Nike on a budget.<br />So I've lost about 55# so far so I had to replace all my gym clothes. And for the first time I've had a decent enough body to wear tank tops in public! These are great for the money and plan on buying these again!
6593,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great for kicking around Great dress for kicking around.  Not high quality, but the fabric is very forgiving.  Get it wet and it dries quickly, and no wrinkles!  The only th8ng i really don‚Äôt like is the seam in the front.  The polka dots don‚Äôt match up, which makes it look a bit tacky."
6594,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great leggings highly recommend ! I‚Äôm obsessed with these leggings. They fit in a similar way to gym shark leggings. They are so so flattering, I don‚Äôt know yet if they‚Äôre moisture wicking as I haven‚Äôt done a high intense workout but I will be ordering in every color!"
6595,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,So much nicer in person These two sweatshirts fit perfect.  ordered 2 mediums I weigh about 160 5 9 and after washing it fit perfect
6596,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Base layer Nice base layer. Would never wear just the tanks themselves. Always under another tank. They‚Äôre a bit long but that‚Äôs okay. I just tuck them in.
6597,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"These are good quality shirts These are good quality shirts, they fit a little looser than other compression shirts, but are still quality shirts. Will definitely recommend them to anyone who are looking for good compression shirts. Shipping was fast and they came well packaged. Definitely a good product."
6598,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits great! Product is great!
6599,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice and stretchy and super comfortable Did not dissapoint, I need to buy more!"
6600,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice & cool Perfect for summer. A bit small but ok otherwise
6601,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"It looks good and fits just right I was looking for a inexpensive hoodie for work. Had to be inexpensive because it will have a short hard life. It looks good and fits just right, nice fuzzy inside. I think it may be nicer than my expensive one. Gonna get another one in a different color."
6602,5,B009R09Z8W,1,great for price Nice quality
6603,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,GOOD GOOD
6604,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,A little too baggy They are comfortable
6605,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Product for workout wear This is really good product for workout
6606,5,B076QD9NP1,1,soo adorable! I had never heard of this brand so I was worried.  I was completely surprised by the lovely quality and design. will order again!!!!
6607,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Exceeded Expectations Got these leggings on Friday and have already worn them twice (it's Monday:)!!!  They don't slip and are very flattering!
6608,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Pretty smooth feeling Pretty smooth feeling. Not sure I really like the look (on me), but there's nothing bad about the design or fit."
6609,5,B0928FSGGD,1,no surprises no surprises
6610,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,6‚Äô 145lb small fit I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 145 pounds and the small fit me perfectly with room for muscle growth.

6614,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Love Comfortable, good quality"
6615,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Love the hoodie It's very bright tye dyed perfectly
6616,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Very cute dress It is cute and I do like the soft fabric. Its runs rather small in the bust. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that it has pockets in the skirt and one is set significantly higher than the other. Hoping it wont be noticeable. Otherwise no complaints
6617,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Loved them! These were the perfect fit and squatproof.
6618,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Simple design and fit. Good workout shirt for the price. Would buy again.
6619,5,B0928FSGGD,1,These are great shirts. Great material These are great shirts.  Great material.  I have received so MANY compliments when i wear the pink one especially .
6620,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Smaller than expected Love these but, I wanted them baggy the xlarge is tighter than I thought they‚Äôd be."
6621,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Four Stars nice quality
6622,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Comfortable Base layer Very comfortable and breathable material. It also makes me feel powerful and works as a base layer.<br />They also don't creep up either while I lift.
6623,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Love it
6624,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect fit. Right color I've been wearing Russell Athletic since my high school grid iron days. The quality remains the same. Other than Champion, nothing else comes close. Perfect fit. Right color."
6625,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Perfect! Very comfortable and the colors are so lovely, fits nice"
6626,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Durable, squat and sweat proof! Truly high waisted. Love that the material is stretchy but semi thick and durable. Squat and sweat proof...just tried them today! Waist band is nice and long/thick and doesn't lose it's shape or become saggy. These are truly high waist...they reach above my belly button which Is awesome for hiding the 3-baby-belly. ;) will def be ordering more colors."
6627,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Best gym shirt ever! I love these! Fits perfectly! They are light and don't feel heavy or sticky when wet. I've had them for 9 months and wear them every week and not one thread is loose. I am 5.7 190lbs(gym built) with a 42 chest and 35 waist  and got a medium. It fits jus right on my chest and a lil loose in the waist which is perfect! If you want a overall loose fit you may wanna go up a size.
6628,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Feel and fit great Love them!
6629,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Snug not tight
6630,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Love the Russell brand.  This crewneck sweatshirt is great.
6631,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great workout shirts I sweat quite a bit so I wanted a workout shirt to keep me cooler.  These work great for me.
6632,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Perfect fit for me I didn't know what to expect, but the fit was great"
6633,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"They are fitted but comfortable I bought these to use in the gym on cooler days. They fit so comfortable but are fitted, not loose but dont feel tight if that makes sense. They are very figure flattering. And the leopard print is just precious!"
6634,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars They were a gift and they loved them both fit as expected
6635,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great fit! Love the tank tops!

6638,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Bright Sweatshirt I love the color for biking at dusk or dark - but my grandson said ""you gotta be kidding me""  lol"
6639,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good workout shirts. Love them. Perfect for working out!
6640,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect when the weather is cold Perfect for when the weather is cold but not cold enough for a coat
6641,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Happy wife, happy life. Wife loves them."
6642,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product at great cost The shirt makes my body look good
6643,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,It's A Sweathirt I use sweats as pajamas: they do the job and are relatively inexpensive...
6644,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Nothing I love these under shirts. They help keep my shirt dry and help keep me cool.
6645,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"For the price it'd be hard to find better I think The material is comfortable, and light."
6646,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Four Stars Just a little big
6647,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Shirts are a nice moisture wicking material Shirts are a nice moisture wicking material. I agree with another reviewer that the grey shirt seems to be a slightly different material than others (I got the grey, black, and white), but I don‚Äôt find it any less comfortable. I ordered a Small (usually XS in tops from most brands), but still find the shirts a bit snug. I knocked off a star because of the sizing issue and my concern that they‚Äôre going to possibly shrink really fast due to constant washing of my workout clothes. But overall, I‚Äôm very satisfied."
6648,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,BUY THESE These have been the best leggings so far. And they're squat test approved by yours truly. (and my sister)
6649,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Fit I love the fit.,it‚Äôs a little long but on only 5ft. But the color is great, I‚Äôd buy more again."
6650,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Fit great First, if you're looking for a thick, heavy fabric sweatshirt, this one's not for you. This is a bit thinner, softer fabric. I like that personally. I have thicker ones but that's not what I was looking for. I don't think I've ever bought anything from Russell that wasn't well made, fit well and lasted."
6651,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,üòÅ My son loves it!
6652,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Cute and comfy! Fits as expected - bought a small for my friend (size 2-4) and a medium for me (size 6-8). Soft material and the cut of racerback is flattering!
6653,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Very comfortable I love these shirts. Very comfortable! Snug, but not too tight.  I ordered a large and it is perfect. Sleeve length is perfect and overall length is good."
6654,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Oalka joggers Rock! Fit like a glove. My daughter loved them.  Highly recommend
6655,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Buy 1-2 sizes up These are cozy but I would have preferred them to be a bit looser. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and about 140 lbs. usually I wear a Medium but I bought a Large after reading reviews. So glad I did because these fit perfectly, but I actually wish they were a bit looser since I mainly bought these to throw on over my swim suit after my daughter‚Äôs swim lessons.  I should have ordered a XL."
6656,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great fit Love these shirts for spin!
6657,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great casual dress Very flattering. Wear with tights or leggings and a boot or bootie. Material is stretchy and not too thin. Washes well and holds up nice. Wash gentle cycle cold water and dry on low temp for 15-20 minutes and hang up. No pilling. No fading at all
6658,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Very Soft Material Daughter liked this Very Much!!! Soft, Comfortable, Great Pockets, not sure about it being pass waistline but is ok. Keeper!!!"
6659,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Comfortable I bought these to wear under low cut shirts so to not show cleavage.  They worked for that.  I personally would not wear these alone because they are form fitting.  I have  to much belly.  But if you have a slender figure and no belly then they are great.  I still like these shirts.
6660,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Do it! These workout tops are the best!!! They are not tight/form fitting so you can be comfortable while getting your sweat on! And the sides are open (but not too open) for the perfect amount of ventilation! I loved mine so much I had to get another color!!!for reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 145lbs I got the Medium!
6661,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Five Stars It's a bit large on my 6-year-old daughter, but still very cute."
6662,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,beautiful product great value for the money
6663,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Amazing Fit I wanted something like a Stringer, but I wanted to make sure the shirts were able to breath. These bad boys allow enough airflow and fit amazing. I will definitely buy more."
6664,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,good qualiyy i am a chinese manÔºå6 feet and 185lbÔºåit's a little bit large for meÔºåbut the quality is goodÔºåwarm and soft. like itÔºÅ
6665,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Cinfirtable I love tops I wear them daily under other tank tops, to bed, etc. they are so comfortable."
6666,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"These are fantastic!! Holds up in all the right places and creates a nice shape all over. I got an XS in steel blue marl. I'm about 128lbs, 5'3"". They look tiny out of the package but you just put them on like pantyhose in the beginning and adjust so all it placed correctly. I like a tight fit. The area around the tummy works how it is supposed to! Thank goodness. I love these and I will get more colors soon."
6667,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Soft and Comfortable yet flattering I love these dresses, although I wear them as tunic tops with leggings.  They are so comfortable.  They are super soft.  They fit will.  They maintain appearance wash after wash and last forever it seems."
6668,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great work out shirt just gotta get the right size. Once I got the right size I love how the shirt fits and shoes off my upper body.
6669,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Good price! Nice! It goes perfect with my camouflage leggings!!!<br />I‚Äôll buy more colors.
6670,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Order a a size up It feels nice. Arrived on time. But definitely order up a size. I wear a 2x and ordered a 3x hoping it would be a little roomy. Not at all. It fits perfectly.
6671,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great quality and fit! My husband bought these and loved the fit! He is 5‚Äô11‚Äù 225 pounds with love handles and very sensitive about how shirts fit him. These shirts fit him great! He received compliments and one of his friends ordered some that night!
6672,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great all the way around!! Always reliable material and fit!!
6673,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Love the color
6674,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Love the color tie dye pattern Was a little thinner than I expected. But appreciate the range of sizes. Love the color tie dye pattern, was as advertised."
6675,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Decent I like it
6676,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Four Stars These seemed good but fit as little small
6677,5,B0B16Q1854,1,NICE NICE
6678,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great comfy dress Ordered sizing based off of reviews and it was perfect.
6679,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits true to size Love these!
6680,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Decent workout shirt Good product for the price.
6681,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Unbeatable value Im 6ft and 180 pounds large fits pin point perfect. I cant believe how good the quality is for the price and the 3 pack deal is unbeatable.
6682,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"glad I read the reviews and ordered the right size Make sure you order one size smaller as they run bigger than expected.  I ready the reviews and did just that, glad I read the reviews and ordered the right size."
6683,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Beach Coverup w/ Other Lives! What did I dislike? Any seamstress would have put the seam up the back (& at least came w/in reason to match the print). The fact that the front dip up some is a good fashion statement; but, still no excuse for sloppy pattern design. That being said, in the wide world of movement, flow, & most outfits fitting more like bathing suits, nobody was ever going to notice this. Especially given the fact that it was my last minute decision to wear it to a graduation ceremony in lieu of a beach party. It was a perfect last minute decision. Living in FL. I'll be wearing it to as many parties and trips to the grocery as I will the beach. It is flowy & comfortable. Actually quite well made (bra adjustment straps) aforementiond diss notwithstanding. & we are seriously talking, what, under $20! I want More! Oh, & there were like 3 black polka dot dresses in the crowds and this was, by far, the best fashion statement!"
6684,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Super comfortable, great length for shorter people! I love this dress so much, I was afraid it would look too much like a nightgown without a belt to give it some shape, but it's actually cute without it. Its super comfortable, love the pockets, and the length is good. It fits me now at 10 weeks pregnant, and I can see it working later in pregnancy as well (its very loose). I'm 5'2 129lbs and a 36B, the medium fits me great, but I could probably get away with a small if I didn't need room to grow :P. If you are tall I think this dress will probably be too short for you, because it just skims the ground on me at 5'2."
6685,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love it. Loved this dress. I get tons of compliments from total strangers!  Very comfortable and flattering and love the pocket too.
6686,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,These are some of my most fav yoga pants I‚Äôve bought to date! Love this for everyday wear! Super comfy!
6687,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Nice Cheap material but cute around the house.
6688,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,They fit amazing Love them got them for a undershirt for my scrubs and they are by far the best quality on amazon that I have bought they are like a dry fit material so they are still really breathable
6689,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Good color, nice light hoodie. This is just a good well made hoodie, and the sizes are fairly accurate. I lost my hoodie string already, and the fabric does stain easily, sadly got a small stain on one of the sleeves. However, I could easily recommend this comfortable hoodie to any guy or gal."
6690,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Quality and Feel I normally take a large but sometimes an XL so ordering online is a crapshoot. Not only did this sweatshirt fit perfectly, it is good quality and feel rich and warm when worn. I would order more."

6705,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Cute with one flaw I love the outfit‚Ä¶ The only thing I do not like is how sheer it is. You definitely have to have a nude bra or a red bra to go underneath it. Anything else shows through.
6706,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell is a good brand. exactly what I needed, Russell is a good brand."
6707,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"What I was looking for! This dress suited my needs well - I'm tall and it was long enough to wear with just tights. Material was thick enough to not be see-through. It is a clingy material, but the dress is plenty loose/flowy. I actually belted it around the waist to give a little more shape"

6721,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable and cool I bought these for travel, as they don't look wrinkled despite being in a suitcase or bag (even when it looks wrinkled coming out of the bag). Colors are pretty and it stays in place, even after a lot of movement. I will probably buy them in other colors too."
6722,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love Russell sweatshirts I ordered this sweatshirt for myself. I‚Äôm a woman 5‚Äô5‚Äù 118lb. I‚Äôve always bought men‚Äôs Russell sweatshirts so I knew a small would fit. I love it. I got one for my son for Christmas too. It‚Äôs a great weight material and and super soft.

6728,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good For Workouts Just got these tanks. They are great. Lightweight and comfortable. Some reviews refer to the mesh as a problem. They are a workout tank! I normally take a XXL but got the XXXL and they fit great. Liked them enough I ordered 3 more.
6729,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Don‚Äôt hesitate - just buy it! Love this dress!  For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and I bought a size M. It has the perfect weight, length and flow. I also bought the red and white too.  Straps are adjustable so you can tailor it to your perfect fit.  It‚Äôs great with a simple white top underneath for modesty, or paired with a Jean jacket. It‚Äôd also be great a a cute summer dress or swimsuit coverup. Buy it!"

6731,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"I am pleased with these ‚Ä¶.

6762,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Excellent fabric The quality is great, breathable and does not itch while at the gym. Dries quickly. If you stand 5'8 and weigh around 165-170lbs and would like yours to be a bit snug, small will be perfect for you."

6772,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,sweat clothes i like a lot
6773,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Cool and comfy I purchased this dress for travel to a very warm climate.  It was a little big, but it was delivered late and I didn‚Äôt have time to exchange before my trip.  I decided to wear  it with a tank underneath and it was cute, comfy and cool."
6774,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Perfect
6775,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,great just right
6776,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Cute but wash first! Definitely cute! Fit the way I expected. But when you open it there is a unpleasant scent that comes off of it. But definitely worth it.
6777,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,As advertised Very comfy and durable
6778,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Amazing product. Perfect size and high quality product.definately good value for money. Highly recommended.. 5 stars.

6782,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars my little one LVOED this kitten dress!
6783,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great buy ! Well made , nice fabric and excellent price. Fits true to size"
6784,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"The bottom rolls up I am using them for lymphedema due to mastectomy surgery , they are wonderful they woke my nerves up around my left shoulder blade and I can move my arm now .  What I dislike is the roll up the bottom of them ."
6785,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Sooooo CUTE! I love this dress, it is a cutie! Fits well, does cling a little but makes it look sexy if that's the look you're going for. I got lots of compliments when I wore it on a trip. Will be ordering another for sure!"
6786,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great quality and very good material
6787,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Cute. This is really cute.  I ordered the black and wore it with black leggings and knee high black boots, and a long chain necklace.  It was comfortable and looked nice for a semi casual office. Definitely not clingy, if you order the right size. It was loose and flowing, perfect to hide the bulges.  I am 5‚Äô4, 160 lbs, with some mama pudge in the center, and I ordered an XL.  When I first tried it on I thought it was a little big,  The arms came down a little long, but I have short arms, and short legs, but I washed AND dried it in the drier, and it fits perfectly.  I would NOT consider it a ‚Äúsweater‚Äù by any means, but it is a thicker, warm material (thicker than a t-shirt). I didn‚Äôt feel the need to wear another sweater over it (on a mildly chilly day), and I am a person who is cold all the time!  It will be cute with a scarf when the weather gets colder.  I ordered another in the dark green, I would have ordered the gray, but I have an actual sweater dress in gray. And I also like the cranberry color, but I have another similar dress in that color. Trying not to look like I‚Äôm wearing the same dress every day. LOL. But out of the other two similar dresses, this is my favorite."
6788,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Buy up two sizes! I love these under my scrubs. Comfy and keeps me warm. Arms are a little long, but not a deal breaker. Do buy up two sizes for comfy fit (still tight but not sausage tight). Highly recommend. Bought xxl."
6789,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,I love this dress but the shoulder straps are too long I love this dress but the shoulder straps are too long. It is a bit big in the chest but I like loose fitting clothes. A few stitches on the straps and it will be good to go
6790,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Looks great. Feels good.
6791,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Runs small There is not as much bagginess you‚Äôd expect when wearing these but they still comfy but if u have muscular legs expect these to fit like leggings Bc I got the medium Bc that‚Äôs my size and I have twig legs and they fit like a small with almost no extra room
6792,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great dress LOVE THIS! Super lightweight and airy. Looks really cute belted or just with flip flops.
6793,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Great sweatshirt
6794,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice sweater Nice sweat top. Will buy again
6795,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Nice -- fit true to size, contrary to what I read I normally wear a medium, and I ordered an extra large based on what I read in the reviews.  It is definitely large on me.  The large should have been fine, and I'm guessing the medium would have been fine, too.  It's a light t-shirt material and has a nice flow to it."
6796,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars It's very comfortable
6797,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great fit & durability Love these tops on my husband. He loves the way they fit
6798,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,great buy fit's perfectly. I was a little hesitant to buy this since I don't usually buy clothes on amazon but with the help of the size chart I chose the perfect one. I'm definitely going to get some others in different colors.
6799,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Everything I wanted I love these tanks, they are everything that I was expecting! They fit just right! Definitely would recommend!"
6800,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars My favorite sweatshirt.
6801,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"nice not as much compression as I would have liked, fit was more like a fitted t-shirt, but will purchase more as I wear these under my scrubs for work."
6802,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fit is right and fabric feels good The tanks feel good. The fit is comfortable and it seems to whisk the sweat as you‚Äôre working out.
6803,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fit I love it. Would order it again
6804,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great everything My husband loves them

6815,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Nice size cant get the size here in Canada regularly
6816,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Finally a good undershirt! This is a great undershirt! I hate hate hate cotton! These have good stretch & fit like a glove... I ordered a large & it actually gives slight compression so I'll order a medium next & should have a little more compression.
6817,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great quality! Great quality! Fits great! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù/135 lbs female and a little baggy as I want.
6818,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Very comfy! These are more of a junior cut than a women‚Äôs so order a size up if you want them baggy. I ordered another pair

6825,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Great for pregnancy. I'm a plus size, first time mom. I'm 5'11 and 6.5 months pregnant. My jeans, even though they're very comfortable, aren't maternity so I decided to try dresses. I'm usually pretty self-conscious but I'm glad I bought this dress. I loved it! I also bought a dark grey one but it doesn't fit like this one does. I tried this one on and kept it on for a little while because it was so comfortable. Highly recommend!"
6826,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Buy these! Amazing joggers! A Lulu dupe for sure! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù/145lbs and ordered a medium. They fit true to size, love the smooth waistband - no digging in! I‚Äôve received many complaints and have sent my fiends the link to purchase. After my initial purchase, I bought 2 more pairs! You will not be disappointed!"

6835,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Four Stars Love this too. It is a little shorter than it appears on the model but true to size.
6836,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Bought them for my wife.  She likes! She is small frame 5'4"" 120 pounds.  Small would have worked but she likes them a little looser so Medium was just right.  Small would have been skin tight."

6841,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Tighter Fit which I Love I am the wife on my husband's account and these shirts were bought for me. I bought these to layer under my personal training shirt. Needed something that wasn't bulky and was tighter to my body. These definitely fit the bill. Although all three say they are made of the same material they definitely do not all feel the same. The maroon and black one were a shiny silky feeling while the gray one was thicker and not as soft. Also, I have longer arms so the sleeves were a tad short. Overall though they do look very cute and washed very well."
6842,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Overall good fit, though Not as long as I'd hoped. Overall good fit, though."

6844,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Runs big worth the money I wear this as a house dress but it‚Äôs something I could wear to the store. It‚Äôs a youthful style but it‚Äôs more conservative with it‚Äôs length. It‚Äôs loose in the chest if you‚Äôre modest

6847,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Always gets compliments! Love this dress! I am petite (5‚Äô2‚Äù) and was afraid it would be too long for me. But the straps are adjustable so I was able to make the length just right. It is so comfortable.  The dress looks beautiful and I always get compliments when I wear it. It looks more expensive than it cost.
6848,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Really cute and comfortable love it!

6856,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Very Comfortable & Functional Workout Shirts My wife loves the Neleus Women's Dry Fit Athletic Compression Long Sleeve T Shirts. She is 5‚Äô2‚Äù & 115 lbs, the size Small fits her perfectly. She doesn‚Äôt like her shirts really tight, but snug enough to keep her warm & wick sweat away while running. The sleeves & torso of the shirts are plenty long & do not ride up on her, fall or sag open while doing yoga & running.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this review, I hope it was helpful."

6861,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fit Good
6862,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,A great Jacket!!! Fit as expected. I had bought one of these years ago and it got ketchup spilled on it and i never could get the hugh stain out of it.. admittedly I was hesitant about ordering this on online.  But I love it and it fits great üëç and its soo soft!!! As a matter of fact I'm ordering another one tonight from them!!!!
6863,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Sharp looking Nice look and feel around the midsection
6864,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Super cute!! I did return this item. So, why did I give it a four review? It‚Äôs adorable! It flowed well when walking. The fabric is not stretchy‚Äîwhich I wanted‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt leave much room for the bust. Even with my minimizer, it was just not happening. It is also pretty low cut, so if you‚Äôre a person that needs a solid undergarment to assist, this may not be the dress for you."
6865,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cute and unusual , great fit Fits well and the stretch in the fabric helps with  a great fit. A bit loose at the waist so hides the tummy. I would buy more colors."
6866,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great value and quality I‚Äôm a huge fan of seamless style leggings but it bothers me to pay $50+ for workout gear! These leggings fit great! I‚Äôve worn and washed them a few times now and they are holding up. Love the compression in the waistband and the length is perfect; no bunching at the ankle for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 size 8/10 in jeans and ordered the mediums. Have two pairs now and am about to buy more. I highly recommend these. They‚Äôre great for working out, lounging around or running errands."
6867,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,second time purchasing nice material
6868,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good hoodie &lt;3 One of the best hoodies for the price. I usually wear small, but I thought medium would be nice and comfy size. Turned out it was a little bigger than expected, but it's good enough to look a little fluffy for my size."
6869,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great Alternative to Ne Brands These are awesome! Fit great, and look better than name brands"
6870,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good quality and good fit
6871,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfecto Bien ,.pero la tela se despelusa"
6872,4,B07XD71F1H,1,Pretty Good This dress is pretty good.  I got an XL and it was a tad bit smaller than I was expecting and didn‚Äôt have much stretch to it.  It felt like it was almost too short. It wasn‚Äôt too short and maybe it just felt odd because it had a bit of a tighter feel than I was expecting and didn‚Äôt have as much stretch as I anticipated.  I got the dark green and it is a great color and good dress.  I threw a cape sweater over it just because I felt it was a tad tight and short and I liked it much better.  I have a similar dress from years ago that is super stretchy and flowy and that‚Äôs what I expected with this dress and it just wasn‚Äôt the same.  Overall good dress and I don‚Äôt know that I would recommend sizing up but it is ever so slightly on the smaller side
6873,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Es lo mejor Me agrado much√≠simo y la uso para el gymm y estar en casa.

6884,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Good deal for the price Good dress for the price. Great for my cruise and beach vacations. The tie on the side shoulder is weird so I pulled it all the way through and tie it in the back. I wear it backwards with the keyhole in the back.
6885,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great undershirts What I was looking for.  Nice
6886,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Great Summer dress Great Summer dress
6887,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Really good product I used this product for working out since I don't like taking my shirt off while working out. Honestly it's just the same as having your shirt off because it is really breathable and isn't tight. It's also really comfortable.
6888,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice for body building. Nice fit...Love the way they fit. Especially on back days. Lats get all pumped up and look huge.
6889,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great bargain. Purchased 2 of these last year. Wear the heck out of them. Now I purchased 2 more. Great bargain.

6895,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great product Great product. Very comfortable.
6896,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Hooded Zip-up Sweatshirt, Black, X-Large I like this sweater due to its PLAIN. Its not to thin and not to thick. It has what I call the perfect medium weight for normal weather conditions.<br />Obviously if your going some where, where its going to be snowing this normal sweater wont cut it.<br />Where it is great is when I come from outside normal 65 degree weather to normal inside temp and I can be comfortable in both environments with out having to remove the sweater."
6897,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Exactly what you'd want in a Gym Tank Fits great, looks great. I'm 5' 11"" 195lbs and Medium fits me perfect. It's almost a jersey material so it'll rub the nipples raw if you're running too much. 2 miles is fine for me but after that you may need band aids. Speaking of AIDS, these are perfect for getting you attention with the ladies. But only if you're a thiccc boy. If you pull up with rolls falling out the sides or spaghetti noodle arms in one of these bad boys, you might as well go home."
6898,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great fit for those aspiring Sith Lords. Sometimes I throw on the hood to the black one and tell new gym members ""good, let the hate flow through you, embrace the power of the dark side"".<br />Yes, I'm a gym rat and a dork."
6899,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Great for snow Bought these for underclothes for the snow, worked great! Got my size and they fit on the tighter side (which is what I wanted), and kept me very warm!"
6900,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Not just for the guys! Bought these for my husband but he decided he didn't like the racerback style, so I claimed them. Since they were for him, I'm wearing a large in the pics. I'm 5' 5"", about 150 lbs‚Äì‚Äìa medium probably would have fit me more like a feminine tank, but I like the loose fit! Nice workout tanks for the price :)"
6901,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Fits great Perfect top
6902,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"These are great. I‚Äôm 6ft, 140 lbs and ordered a small. The fit great and super comfy. Go from belly button to ankles. Just ordered a couple more."
6903,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great item!!!
6904,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good fit Really nice shirts. True to size and light weight breathable mesh. I got the ones pictured in photo with lettering on back. Not sure if all color combos have same same design on back. When I initially chose colors that particular color combo showed the backs blank.
6905,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Just what I needed I love these shirts. I always say find something you like and stick with it. I've purchased six of these shirts and I'll probably buy more soon.
6906,4,B09M6X79V9,1,JUST OKAY I bought these as a top for my exercise leggings.  They work.  Nothing special.  Launder well.
6907,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,great fit. Fit well overall. Wasn‚Äôt too snug like a dry fit and wasn‚Äôt extremely huge either. Me being 5‚Äô11‚Äù US XL fit me perfect.
6908,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Smaller than you would expect LOVE these shirts.  Glad i ordered one size too big based on other reviews.  I almost wished i had ordered two sizes too big.  Other then that these are great and the price is awesome.
6909,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"So sweet! My daughter absolutely loves this dress. It was a great, age-appropriate dress for a 5yr old who wanted to dress as Katy Perry for Halloween. It's stretchy fabric almost like swimsuit material so it doesn't fade when washed and very comfy."
6910,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"loove these soo silky soft, soo comfy, fits super well, looks cute, love these a lot. highly recommend"

6917,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great price for a great sweatshirt I‚Äôve been wearing Russell Athletics sweatshirts for many years now. I have about a half dozen in various colors. They are a medium heavyweight material which makes them both nice and warm, yet very comfortable to wear. They hold up very well after being washed dozens of time. A word of note, best to dry them for maybe 15 minutes, then let them air dry the rest of the way, as they will shrink a bit. Compared to other brands, the quality and the price can‚Äôt be beat. Go for it! You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
6918,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good product comfortable shirts Ordered 2 three packs and they came before they were scheduled too which was great wish they were about an inch longer but they fit great and are comfortable.

My only complain is the neck size, but most hoodies are snug on my there.  I just made a small cut down the middle to open it up a bit.  Still looks good and much more comfortable.  The color is a good strong navy color.  Haven't needed the wicking function as much but from the feel of it and other wicking fabrics, I am sure it will work just fine.  A good hoody for winter outside wear or lounging around."

It matches my Apple Watch and a lot of my jewelry perfectly. It‚Äôs also so warm and cozy. I ordered a medium because I wanted it to look slightly baggy. It‚Äôs the exact size I was hoping for. You guys should add this to the women‚Äôs section as well. I think you‚Äôd get a lot of orders with this color.
6991,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Adorable dress Looks exactly like pics . I bought Xlarge . I think it runs a bit small . Has some stretch . The cut in shoulders are very slimming and overall it's a really cute dress. The fabric is light but not see thru in black . Looking forward to wearing it this Summer . I don't wear shorts and this dress is stylish enough to wear out or just as a casual nice look. It's very stylish and not frumpy !!
6992,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,MOTHER'S DAY gift for my wife. She loves it ! Dress fits great. Wife loves it !

6995,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Warm & Dry! Best Sweat! Excellent fit and appearance!
6996,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Warm, rich fleece This crew feels terrific, with the softness and warmth of fleece.  I had bought it as a sweatshirt, but it's much too warm for that.  It might be Dri-power but within ten minutes of exercising it was drenched.  Yet I love to wear it as a winter shirt inside and outside the house: style, fit and colors are terrific."
6997,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Awesome hoodie Fits perfectly and after several washes the colors are still vibrant
6998,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Perfect It's soft, warm, durable. Fit is perfect and the color matches the description."

7003,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Looks good and easy to care for They are comfortable and Lie flat underneath the over-shirt. Easy to wash, just with the rest of the laundry."
7004,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Good Fits as expected
7005,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Soft and Hearty Sweatshirt I love these sweatshirts.  I bought one a few years back for my daughter.  I think she's owned it and heavily wore it now for 3 years.  However, it has no holes despite daily wear 7 months out of the year and many, many washings and dryings.  I bought this current sweatshirt for my second child.  He's 13 years old and though a Men's Medium fits him a little large, with a wash and dry and given how quickly boys grow at this age, I think it looks great on him.  Besides, boys wear tops somewhat large.  The color is rich and the fabric is very hearty and soft.  Perfect and at a great price!  Better than even old navy."
7006,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,It is a perfect weight for cold weather. It is nice quality.
7007,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Love the sweatshirts I ordered a couple as gifts for Xmas then ordered more for me!!!

7009,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Super cute and flown Love the soft fabric, the blue is a very happy color especially with the polka dots!  Very flowy and perfect for a warm day."
7010,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,The only thing is I have to take it to ... The only thing is I have to take it to someone to fix the straps because its twisted. so it has to be unsewn and fixed.
7011,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fit was perfect! Just what I wanted....
7012,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Classic with an Update Nice. Update on a classic. Fabric is decent. Definitely summer fabric though it is kind of thin and opague. I was surprised the bottom is kind of an upside down v-shape. So the middle is shorter than the sides like a triangle shape was cut out. (Maybe the pictures dont empahasize this enough? Or maybe it hangd differently on a stick figured woman. Im 5'3&#34; 165lbs and curvy. I wanted a more even, straight classic hemline instead of fad-ish but its ok."
7013,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great hoodie.. It stands up to work and everyday use.. I have no disappointments..
7014,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars Seemed a bit big for an XL, but not so big that it was a problem."
7015,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Dress Dress is cute but you can see through it.

7023,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Value ! Great Quality ! Bought a bunch of these sweaters..<br />You can't go wrong with this purchase.<br />Feels good, looks good & at a great price.<br />I love it !"
7024,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Not GymShark, but close! I got these as a potential GymShark dupe. While I still love my GymShark leggings more, these are pretty comparable for 1/3 of the price. Definitely recommend for good workout gear on a budget!"
7025,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,When drying make sure there is no Velcro! I love how it snugs around my chest but not in a tight way if that makes sense? Long story short I love then
7026,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Price was good love the fabric and feels good on. I liked both fabric and texture also fits nicely. Just what I had been looking for.
7027,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great for the Runs a little large, Great for the price"

7032,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,This sweatshirt fits exactly how I wanted it to.  Just baggy enough to be so comfy Love the fit and the color
7033,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Decent workout tops I use these on pretty much a daily basis and they hold up well. Personally it fit more snug than what I anticipated.. but it‚Äôs still great, especially for the price. I‚Äôd recommend"
7034,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"It fit like a glove The only reason why I brought this certain color, so I can look nice on Valentine's day, coming up"
7035,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good shipping and quality, 5 stars Good sweater"
7036,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell sweatshirt Sweatshirt appears to be well made and is a comfortable fit.  At approximately $20 a shirt it's a real bargain.  Recommended.
7037,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Perfect! Exactly what I was expecting. Fits easy and is very comfortable. Material is soft and cool.
7038,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Comfy pants I LOVE these pants so comfy and fit perfectly!
7039,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good quality.. Fits great.
7040,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell hooded zippered sweater Great sweater. Comfortable. Good quality.
7041,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Fits perfect, great quality, super soft! Very good quality. This is my daughters 4th Jxstar dress. She LOVES LOVES LOVES THEM!<br />She is 4 years old, 41 pounds and 44 inches tall and I ordered her the 6-7 and it fits perfectly."
7042,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Amazing quality, great workout pants! These gym pants are great! I got a compliment about them the first time I went to the gym with them as well.<br /><br />I am about 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 155 lbs. I work out consistently, and have fairly strong/large thighs. The size medium fits me perfectly. The fabric stretches enough to be very comfortable but they never start sliding down. No tugging needed! Also, I ordered the purple color and they are squat proof!<br /><br />I will purchase them in different colors as well. This is an amazing quality, especially for the price."
7043,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good underlayer. I have bought 2 sizes Good underlayer. I have bought 2 sizes, 1 a little looser to use as camisole, 1 to wear sans bra. Need to size down for &#34;compression.  I will by more."
7044,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Four Stars fits
7045,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I look amazing in them These are great for highschool weight lifting and they make you look good while doing it
7046,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars was ok
7047,5,B097RFTKJP,1,great little black dress Loved the dress
7048,4,B09M6X79V9,1,These are very form fitting. I prefer a flowing front that hides and bumps that are there. They are so form fitting and show every bump or bulge thaat the older frame is sure to have.
7049,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Best Pair of Sweatpants I Have Ever Owned! Comfortable, sits mid waist (like it's not high-waisted and it doesn't fall down!) It's not too long, and it's flattering in the back!"
7050,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Good Deal Great price for the quality, I just wish they had the thumb cutouts. I ordered medium. I'm 5'1, 135 pounds and wear a 34 D. They fit great. Length is good to but rides up a little when your doing vigorous exercise."
7051,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Soft lovely dress, great wardrobe staple Very comfortable,  attractive dress that is figure flattering. Great paired with a scarf!"
7052,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great Style Kind of like a muscle tank, but more feminine. Great for working out or going on a hike. Light and breathable. I haven't washed it yet so I can't say how it will hold up or if it will shrink. I hope not! If it holds up, I'll be getting more colors."
7053,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars for long lasting value Russell products are a good bet. These first 2 Russel hooded sweat shirts lasted until I added bleach to the wash, just enough to ruin the sweats and its happened to sweatpants. I have purchased 4 more over last 4 years."
7054,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Listened to other reviews...get one size down... very comfortable.. Get Large if you normally get XL...runs large but one size down.. perfect.
7055,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Just as expected- soft! This sweatshirt color was exactly as displayed, fit as I expected and was super soft, and not too heavy.  I was purchasing it for my halloween cosutme (vanellope von shweetz) but I'm sure will be wearing it plenty throughout the winter!"
7056,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Beautiful Fit! This is the most unbelievable fit! Order true to size. It fits extremely well as a dress by itself or as a top over tights. It lays well over curvy areas. I love it!
7057,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Five Stars Love it, very colorful."
7058,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great fit! The cost is cheap for the material you get, it‚Äôs snug and fits perfectly, and makes you look way bigger!"
7059,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Really like these pants.  Fit well, and the dark gray color is great."
7060,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,My son loves this sweatshirt for work My son loves this sweatshirt because it is super thick and warm and also is orange in color which is a safety feature when working in a warehouse environment.
7061,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,So nice leggings to workout I like it nice and comfy and good quality
7062,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great material Great for outdoor activities when slightly chilly. Using these for cycling in the fall/spring and they are working great. Strong fabric, not cheaply made in any way."
7063,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Love it. A true bargain
7064,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Wear to work out, run errands, as an u see tank or lounging. I love these tanks. But sad to mention my sleeve part had fallen apart. The stitch where you put your arm in has separated. Instead of 3 I‚Äôm down to two. Still love em"
7065,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Jerzees Pullover Sweatshirt I like the color which is called Texas Orange or something like that - not blue as listed.  Fit is fine after wash.  It is thinner than other sweatshirts I have bought so I am hoping that this one will work out.
7066,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Cozy sweatshirt Walking outside
7067,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"They fit fine enough to work They fit fine enough to work, but they felt like different styles. The white barely fit, the gray was a little better and the black was the perfect fit. I'm not sure what happened."
7068,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Size up I sized up to get more of the traditional jogger fit. If you want more of a legging style fit your usual size would be just fine. Absolutely amazing, super comfortable, and will buy in other colors."
7069,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Nice product for the price Fits nice with comfortable design.
7070,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Satisfied 5‚Äô5/140  comfortable, fitted, not restrictive, perfect for working out and under scrubs. Ordered more in different colors :)"
7071,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,I like it Good
7072,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,My go-to sweatshirt Love so much I ordered 2 more! I might have one in every color by the end of the year.
7073,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Fits everywhere but the behind. These pants are so soft and very comfortable! I have a plumper behind so they‚Äôre a bit tight and ride down when I bend over but if I keep the drawstrings tight this minimizes the problem. If you have a flatter butt these would fit perfectly for you! If not, I would recommend going up a size."
7074,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great top Great top, very comfort"
7075,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable and warm, but very large The sweatshirt I received was very warm and felt nice. It's quite thick, though that may make it less than ideal for certain athletic uses. However, the XL seems to be larger than a XXL with other brands, so keep that in mind when buying. It also had a very strong chemical scent when I received it, so definitely make sure to wash before wearing - though that's fairly common and washing is recommended with any clothing purchase anyway."
7076,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Would purchase these again! These are a great workout tank to have. I have worn them many times and am very satisfied. The white one is more see through than I care for, but the quality is still nice. They keep me feeling cool, but aren't necessarily moisture-wicking. They have held up nice in both the washer and dryer--no fraying or coming apart at the seems. They also do not ride up on me when wearing them at home or during a workout, which is a huge plus. I have had issues with shirts like that in the past, and it is very uncomfortable. They seem to be a tad longer than some shirts, so that is probable why they perform so well. Sadly these were bought right as I found out I was pregnant, so I can't wear them for very long, but I'll enjoy it while it lasts!"
7077,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"If you want Tighter go One Size Smaller I received these compression tanks in size small and they weren't tight enough for me.  I would say the size chart is true to size and you would have to get a size smaller for any sort of compression.  Another note is the material is pretty thin, so if you had to go down multiple sizes, I'd think about going elsewhere.  I think the price matches the quality, and if you were really looking for a compression garment, this isn't it.  I'm using these to wear as undershirts as I like to wear clothing that is very tailored, and cotton tanks are too bulky.  I am 6' ft tall & thin."
7078,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Makes me look big Light weight but not see through
7079,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Workout comfort. Great to wear for workout.  Comfortable.
7080,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"great summer dress Nice soft and light dress for summer.  Will be nice and cool for summer. Is a little larger than expected, but my granddaughter will probably be able to wear it next year also."
7081,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,na na
7082,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweatshirts for the price The quality of the material was great and the shirts fit as well
7083,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"great sweater, at a great price long lasting russell ... great sweater , at a great price long lasting russell athletics is all i wear"
7084,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Great Dress! Fits well without clinging to your body, flatters your figure."
7085,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Best workout shirts -- tight around the chest and lose around the waist area Definite go to for workout shirts, comfortable, breathable material!"
7086,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Overall a good buy The shirts fit great along the chest but were a little too long at the bottom. Afraid if I got a size smaller it would be too tight at the top.
7087,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº Excellent purchase!  Highly recommend. Fits great and very soft.
7088,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Just Right My boyfriend loves it, he loves the fit, the color and the material"
7089,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Very good quality and warm , size alert I love it. so comfortable and warm , if you wear XL you need to order large<br />I received 2 and they let me keep it , this is awesome , also very fast delivery<br />A great buy"

7091,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,As advertised. Exactly what I expected. Fits great
7092,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Oooooh yeah! Favorite workout shirt! Will I order 5 more? Yes.
7093,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good good
7094,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Love it! Comfortable and goes with anything!
7095,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Excelente Excelente
7096,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Size Large, 5 ft, 6 in, 140 pounds, fitness runner, well built I'm well-built but slender and ordered a Size LARGE and I'm glad I did.  These tops are very form-fitting and snug.  I bought them to wear under loose-fitting tops during the winter, but they're perfect for running in the sweltering heat. I would definitely buy again."
7097,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great quality Fell in love with them immediately. I‚Äôm a size 2/26 in jeans as well as 5‚Äô1 height and got a XS. They fit perfectly.
7098,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Fits Well, Well-Made These are super soft and well-made. The X-SM is a perfect fit for me (5'2&#34;, 105 lbs, average chest), but they're just a little longer than I need. If I tuck it into jeans, it almost gets to my crotch. Since I use them for undershirts in the winter, I'd prefer a tiny bit shorter."
7099,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Adorable and fun little dress! My daughter lives this little cute and soft dress! Good quality!
7100,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"I like this top! When i took it out of the pack I wasn't quite sure of about the top. But after trying them on, it was really a nice fit and very flattering to my shape."
7101,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice fit, nice price Nice fit , nice price!"
7102,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Love it! except the lighter colors not squat proof Absolutely love love love these leggings! I got them in the xs and they perfectly fit my petite 5ft frame. Workout leggings are usually too long on me and scrunch up at the ankles, but I don‚Äôt have that problem with this brand! The material is so comfy to workout in and I love the level of compression. The only down side is that the lighter colors are NOT squat proof. I had no problem with the grey charcoal. But the dark pink/pink ombr√© and the steel blue did not pass the squat test. Will be ordering the darker colors from now on"
7103,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Runs small My wife purchased both this one and the black one. The black fit perfectly but this one ran smaller.
7104,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Fit perfect Like the feel of them
7105,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Four Stars The fit

7109,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Fantastic! Super comfy and pretty stretchy. I ordered it a bit too tight, but it‚Äôs totally worth it and I might order more."
7110,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Take your measurements for the seamless, true to size! I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù tall, ~160-170# (I haven‚Äôt weighed myself is awhile, it‚Äôs a guess!)<br />Waist 31‚Äù<br />Hips 44‚Äù<br /><br />I bought a XL in the forest green seamless, they are AMAZING.  If I wanted a little more compression I‚Äôd buy the Large, but the waistband, the length, the fabric stretch and durability, everything is fantastic.<br />Because I sized up, when I lift in these leggings they do slide down a little.  I feel of I sized appropriately, with a Large rather than XL, they would stay put a little better.<br />Will be buying every color üòÇ"
7111,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars OK
7112,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"STYLE CUTS VARY ! i ordered the pocketless version and i was like ""wish these had pockets!"" then bam! they did...except, the meterial changed--a little thicker but not bad. but i wanted them to be high-waisted and the teal color i ordered was LOW RISE. annoyed, i decided theyd be barn pants and reordered a different color.<br />they sent the wrong item--too big. they send back another pair--correct size, WRONG COLOR. what taf. whatever. i tried them on and they were high-waisted !!! theyre not tbe right color but theyre now the right height--took four pairs of pants to get here.<br /><br />i assume the colors correspond to their waist cuts--such as the super high-waist vs low rise...<br /><br />in the pic, BOTH are a size SMALL.<br /><br />allegedly, the same ""style"".."
7113,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect in every way Perfect in every way!  Thank you for a seamless transaction!  I was 100% satisfied and would not hesitate to do business with them again!
7114,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great top!!! Great over work out tops. Flattering
7115,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Very nice product The fabric is quite nice as it lets you breathe after several washes, the size remained the same.<br /><br />I bought an M size and I'm 6'0 (182.5 cm) with 180 lbs (80kg) - fits perfectly -> just rightly tight (not too much) around the chest and loose over the waist/mid-torso.<br /><br />Definitely recommend given price and quality - very good value for money."
7116,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great quality! True to size! Highly recommend! I ordered one in light green, dark green and black and I‚Äôm thinking about ordering one in every color! These shirts are FANTASTIC!! They fit perfectly, they‚Äôre lightweight, and they‚Äôre great quality! I‚Äôve washed each of them about 3x and they haven‚Äôt faded either. Great price point. Highly recommend! True to size!"
7117,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Light weight looks good Light weight
7118,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Great quality and value, very pleased with these shirts! Very pleased with the size, fit, cut and style! Material is light weight but durable. I'm 5'2&#34; and 120 lbs, I followed the sizing chart and ordered a large. It fits perfect length wise and the sleeves are just right. I like the stiching detail as it adds a little bit of style. I will order more in different colors. Great shirt to wear to gym over my racerback tanks and under my puffer jackets as the weather cools down. Also versatile and can be worn with jeans. Glad I purchased these. Highly recommend them if you're looking for quality and value."
7119,4,B076QD9NP1,1,"Flattering cut, awful fabric. We ordered a size up and it fit perfectly. The fit is very flattering and it was great for a cat themed birthday party. My only issue was the fabric...it was this thin, slippery feeling stuff, not what I would look for in a quality product...but it worked for Florida weather."
7120,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good quality Sweatshirt for the price Great sweat shirt for the price paid.  I have worn Russell and Champion for most of my adult life and<br />love the fit and durability of them.  Will order again when I need to replace this one.
7121,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Cute and nice quality Very cute dress. The quality is nice for the price. It looks cute and fits well.
7122,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Love it. Fits great. Feels great.
7123,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Bought for a gift and it was a winner. This brand  has continued to make high quality clothing for a reasonable price. The fit is always as expected.
7124,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfort These pants are very comfortable. I used them for after surgery and bought 3 pair. I love them. I wear them to appointments and around the house. They have a good stretch to them and are long which is great. Wash great as well.
7125,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great value Great dress for a great price.  Super comfortable and flattering on. Will be ordering more colors.
7126,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Love the material and fit! Washes well, too!"
7127,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Good Quality Overall these shirts are great but of the three, they are all different sizes.  I'm keeping them but buyer beware."
7128,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I like to order a size larger than I should I like to order a size larger than I should, mostly because I am self-conscious of my mid-section. This dress fits perfectly to what I was searching for. I adore the pockets and how lightweight it is.It's a great summertime dress!"
7129,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Good quality Gave to my grandson he loves it
7130,5,B076QD9NP1,1,So cute! Daughter LOVES this dress.  Holds up well in wash and fits beautifully.  Nice soft fabric that moves well.
7131,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars fits well
7132,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Tis great Fits perfect, light and cool."
7133,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Fits as expected My daughter liked it.  The dress was used for a high school danceline dance
7134,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,XXX was too big! Everyone said to order a size bigger than you are but they were just a little too big on me that way. I am going to also order the XL and give the XXL to my bigger son. They are comfortable and feel good under your clothes though.
7135,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"My take on ""The Seam"" I chose the Flower Beige pattern, and when I received this dress the first thing I said was ""Why does this dress have a seam running down the front, weird, this is going back!"" I immediately went to read some reviews and noted that others complained about the seam down the front. ""Def going back!"" But, I liked the fabric and pattern, so the next morning I tried it on again and thought, this isn't so bad after all. The seam that runs down the front is hidden by the folds of the fabric and the deep V in the front of the dress can only be made by having a seam running down the front. I also noted that and the back of the dress is one solid piece of fabric, so no unsightly seam there. Perk! I wore my dress yesterday and received several compliments, several! Couldn't wait to place another order for the Flower Yellow-Black pattern. Personally, I would stay away from the polka dot pattern, but the other patterns seem to hide and blend well with the front and side seams. The dress is really comfy and flows very nicely. It's both casual and dressy depending on how you accessorize. I really like it. Hope this review helps with the seam issues."
7136,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,The quality was great but it seemed a little small for my liking ... The quality was great but it seemed a little small for my liking and I think the next size up would have been to big.
7137,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Sure to keep me warm this winter.
7138,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Very  comfortable and lightweight Extremely comfortable and very lightweight
7139,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great basic sweatshirt! Very comfortable and fits well.
7140,4,B09M6X79V9,1,It was too tight Love the colors. But still fit too tight
7141,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"YOU ARE MISSING OUT! These are the absolute BEST joggers I‚Äôve ever owned. The most comfortable fit - and the chart size is true to size! If you‚Äôre curvy, these will show off your curves in all the right places! These are just so perfect! If you don‚Äôt have them, you need them. So click it babe. Click the buy now button.."
7142,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Beautiful dress I ordered this dress for a night out. It arrived just in time, the only downside was I ordered Black and was sent Navy. I still made it work, it was just upsetting since I didn‚Äôt have time to send it back and wait on a replacement. Regardless it‚Äôs a beautiful dress and I will keep it."
7143,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"these Are not compression items I noticed when I first took them out they were loose with no shape. They are just undershirts. My compression under shirts are tight and when you hold them up you can see where your breasts would go.  These are just undershirts. I got an extra small so it wasn't the size selection,  as a regular undershirt they are fine although they run big; just don't expect compression"
7144,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Material is pretty see through and not compressing anything Just ok.  Material is pretty see through and not compressing anything.
7145,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Cheaply made Terrible
7146,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Poor quality control First sweatpants had the grommet missing at the drawstring waist. Sent it back and received a second pot with the same issue.
7147,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Length then the pockets at the side but shown to the front in the picture Poorly made too short for a maxi dress ...I'm 5'9 not satisfied with the product
7148,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Good material. It was ok. I just didn't expect it to be a little smaller on him but it was ok. Good material.
7149,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"NOT SQUAT PROOF While these leggings looks good on at first, and they have good tummy control- they are NOT squat proof at all. Any bend & you can see through them easily. How embarrassing."
7150,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,TOO LARGE Too Big. Just too big. Extremely disappointed. This is no good guys.
7151,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Another day living with COVID Bought them in a xxl which is bigger then I normally take  to start (I usually wear a large to a Clarke) and when trying it on it was like trying to put your panties on when your bodies wet. It rolls all up your body and your having everything you can do to get it over the added rolls you inherited from country kitchen during this isolation from COVID. I Would definitely get at least 2 times a bigger size in hopes to fit.
7152,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Quality very good. Fit way too small.
7153,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Very Thin Not what I expected, very thin"
7154,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Runs small? Instead of returning I offered them to my kid. The colors are bright and I like them.
7155,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Dress is very see through which is uncomfortable to me.
7156,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Product not as pictured Product had strange seem across the midsection I didn't care for. The images don't show the seem. Uncomfortable to wear return to Amazon.
7157,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Disappointed It fades with the first wash
7158,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Way too small! I ordered a 3x and it would not fit over my shoulders. I gave to my daughter who is a size 10.
7159,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,These don't compress anything. Don't buy this if you're overweight thinking it'll help.<br /><br />The material is incredibly thin and has no strength whatsoever. This is purely for showing off your pecks and abs if you're already built or at least skinny. I was looking for replacement Compression shirts cause Champion stopped making theirs and these are not legit compression shirts. They don't hold anything in place.
7160,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Arrived with a strap already detached The dress is super cute and very summery, but as soon as I took it out of the packaging, I noticed that one of the straps had already torn off. I had to secure it with a safety pin. Disappointed because now I have to worry if the other side is going to do that and I hope it doesn't while I'm wearing it and I am out somewhere. Guess I'll have to keep safety pins with me just in case."
7161,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Size Chart Not Reliable The size chart is off by two sizes, so I returned the items."
7162,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Unimpressed The sleeves feel cheap, but the body part feels like a t-shirt. It is definitely not long enough! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But that's the gamble with buying clothing online."
7163,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Small I ordered a large, fit like a small. Returned."
7164,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Have to return Fine but too similar to another dress I have. Returning. Thanks<br />Sandy
7165,2,B009R09Z8W,0,El largo no es adecuado Material suave . La talla muy corta
7166,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star Way to small not true to side
7167,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Poor stitching on pocket had to repair pocket when I got it poor quality control If had not disposed of the package would have returned it
7168,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Three Stars Even though it was labeled as black,is more a dark grey color"
7169,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"This is the second one I need to return, ... This is the second one I need to return, generous sizes.  My husband usually wears large in a sweat shirt, but even the medium is too big, especially the sleeves, they are very long."
7170,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not long enough I was looking for a longer tank, said yoga tank, but this barley covers abdomen.  Not a long tank if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after"
7171,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression! These are not compression at all! They are very thin see through fabric, falsely advertised and a wate of money!"
7172,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars To large on arms
7173,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Don't. Not high waisted. Also,at nearly 2 inches above my daughter's ankle (at 5'8""). Quickly returned."
7174,2,B09M6X79V9,0,A size chart and better description. Good quality but size not accurate.  Also looking for attach bra support. Description was not much to better understand the kind of sport shirt presented.
7175,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star Ugly
7176,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Not for me I didnt like how this dress looked on me
7177,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Extremely Small!! This run extremely small!! I normally wear a large & ordered extra large. Too small. Then ordered 2XL and it was exactly the same as the XL! Same product that they put a 2XL tag on. Wish I could find these that are true to size!
7178,1,B0928FSGGD,0,"Sizing is way off I purchased, and returned, this item three times.  My wife normally wears a medium.  The medium was more like a petite small.  I tried again with a large.  Way to small.  I returned them again and tried an XL.  They were still skin tight.  The sizes on these shirts are very badly undersized.  I do not recommend as you will not know what size to order to get a proper fit."
7179,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Good As expected
7180,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Rides up constantly Got these to go under my flannel work shirts but they ride up all the time and I am constantly tugging at my clothes to keep them down which is frustrating. If they were a few inches longer it wouldn't be an issue.
7181,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Two Stars material too thin
7182,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,"I didn't like it My size is small, but its small size was very loose for me. I returned that and ordered XS, and it was again loose. So, I returned that again and forgot about this product. (Also it was very open from two sides, that everything was transparent.)"
7183,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Runs small Size up
7184,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression at all It's an okay tank top, not compression at all."
7185,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,get a size smaller than you are for a tight fit these are super soft and comfy but the sizes run large even if you measure your chest and torso to the chart... get a smaller size than you measure. mine are very loose im hoping they shrink in the wash.
7186,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not made of flee Not made of fleece, that's not what I expected üòí 7"
7187,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Unpredictable sizing I have three of these sweatshirts and all three have different proportions depending on the color. This maroon one has sleeves too short and loose cuffs and waist.
7188,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Just okay... Goofy fit. Fits okay. Seems a little short but pretty lose and wide. This material smells a lot after sweating in it and also chaffes me during runs. 3 stars only because they were so cheap.
7189,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,No me sirvi√≥ Ni me lo med√≠ pq nada m√°s de verlo sab√≠a que no me servir√≠a . Devuelto ahh y me cobraron la devoluci√≥n üòî
7190,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Compression tank I thought it would be a tighter fit seeing as it was a compression top.
7191,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star Arms are huge...overly too much fabric
7192,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Stained shirt I‚Äôve order these shirts twice and the white shirt on both orders had a large stain on the front.
7193,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Comfortable but sleeves vary in size One of the sleeves on the grey shirt wasn‚Äôt as long as the other one. So the shirt looked like a 3/4 sleeve on one side
7194,2,B07XD71F1H,0,"Don‚Äôt get it Dress is very clingy and tight and shows every flaw. Not flattering at all. Material is more spandex like then dressy. Doesn‚Äôt flow and the neckline makes you look fat. Unless your a size 2 and no fat rolls, this is not the dress you should get. Looks nothing on like it does on the perfect model"
7195,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"BUMMED Altho these pants are comfortable and yes I bought the right size, they keep rolling down at the top."
7196,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"Color I ordered the safety green color and it was Neon Yellow,very disappointed"
7197,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Not true to size! Definitely not true to size. Mine is much shorter than it appears on the model, like by a foot...and I'm only 5'4. Extremely disappointed with this purchase."
7198,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Butt cheek accentuation didn't line up with my butt I have a smaller waist and bigger butt and thighs, the elastic around my waist stuck out some in the back and didn't cinch to my waist. I am 5'9 and 155 lb. Athletic build and relatively lean, I will be returning because they seem kind of thin and show every dimple of cellulite and the butt cheek polka dots underneath the bum don't line up with the bottom of my bum. Soft material though!"
7199,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not sure No thanks
7200,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Horrible material no compression These tanks are not compression at all.  They are this odd, very, very thin material. And deffinately not sized correctly as well as being very short. I wanted them for layering but they are so  aweful I had to return them."
7201,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Fits too small Ordered a 2XL and it was more like a L.  Fitting but if you don't want to show all your curves order 2 sizes bigger.
7202,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,They smell Shirts looked good and fit fine but everyone i tried on had an overwhelming smell of sweat. But sure what that's about
7203,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Not as Discribed in Picture I personally did not like how they fit, very lose and short."
7204,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Three Stars nice fit
7205,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Hated the quality Didn‚Äôt like the quality every cheap made
7206,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Quality Like the sweat's great color but fit funny on my hips and on my hips I don't think they're gonna work very well if you're a hippie kind of girl if you had a teenage boy body they'd fit great on you or if you were skinny as a stick needs to come Up a little higherIn the waist
7207,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Not soft Not soft not very stretchy
7208,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Where's the fleece? It's a good sweatshirt but I was disappointed because the description says it is a &#34;fleece&#34; sweatshirt but the material has quite a hard finish - nothing soft or &#34;fleecy&#34; about it. I bought it to go with a pair of fleece lounge pants for my husband to wear in the evenings but this is a regular sweatshirt like you'd wear for work, etc."
7209,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Good hoodie Great hoodie, the only complaint is the part that goes around the wrist is very big. The sleeves keep going over my hands. This is the only hoodie I own that does this, and I have a lot"
7210,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Thin & not much compression These tops were very thin & did not offer much compression, they shouldn't be described as compression clothing. They're ok if you just want a thin, sort of stretchy tank top. As a layering piece they do add warmth without bulk so that's what l use them for, or to sleep in they're soft & comfy."
7211,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Bad sizing I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 100lbs, so shopping for clothes is frustrating. I ordered a size XS, the tag on the pants says XS, and the product itself is measuring at a 34‚Äù waist, which is supposed to fit an XL according to the size guide. Also the ‚Äúgray and white‚Äù color is actually gray and pale pink. I‚Äôm really bummed out because the pants seem like they‚Äôre exactly what I was looking for, but they‚Äôre so far off from how they‚Äôre advertised. I will be returning these."
7212,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Love them but I love these tights! They are flattering and squat proof. However this is the second time I‚Äôve ordered from them and they sent me the wrong color. I now have duplicates of colors I had already purchased and still no black. Wish they would fix this. Besides that they are great!
7213,1,B0B16Q1854,0,US Polo Sweatpants The below statement was made before these were washed only twice before they sratered to develope holes. They are small but also very noticable. Wont be buying in different colors anymore. Very poor.<br />Super comfortable but a little long. I'm 5'0 but still no complaining. They are not super heavy and not to thin. I will be buying different colors.
7214,1,B097RFTKJP,0,One wear I washed this one time and it literally turned gray. I've never seen something Fades so fast
7215,3,B09M6X79V9,0,On the small side I ordered 2 sizes bigger than my normal size and they were still tight. But they look and feel nice.
7216,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Great Fit but Ripped My dress fit perfectly, however it was torn underarm on the right side. I was so disappointed."
7217,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Don't expect a quality. Not a good quality. I wash it for first time and the string that gose around your neck the some of thread came off.
7218,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not as described Run very small
7219,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Misleading on coloursüòíüò° I ordered neon pink...The picture they have listed is a bright vibrant hot pink... I received a dull bubble gum pink...Just ruined my entire event!! SO DISAPPOINTED üòûWHY ARE YOU POSTING PICS OF A COLOR YOU DONT OFFER.DO NOT BUY THESE SWEETSHIRT.SO MISLEADING
7220,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Three Stars The breast portion is tight I am not busty, the dress will fit a small busted woman"
7221,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Picture shows Gray and Pink but comes Gray and White These are scratchy and feel cheap. Was really hoping for a comfy pair of sweats! Also they show the gray with pink writing but send gray with white writing! I did not notice it states white writing until I went back to see if I ordered incorrectly. It doesn't read the description when reading from your phone! These will definitely be returned!
7222,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Bright colors... polyester compression I like the slight compression of this top but haven‚Äôt worn them much because of the polyester fabric... I prefer more cotton with spandex
7223,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Cute but didn‚Äôt fit :( These are very cute but don‚Äôt fit as expected
7224,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Not what I expected very flimsy and cheap This wasn‚Äôt what I expected I wanted . I thought the material was thicker softer and not so see through.  These are great for a shell underneath your clothes but not as something to wear regularly. I‚Äôm a fan of under armour cold gear and wanted something similar. This definitely doesn‚Äôt cut it and I‚Äôm afraid to wash these because they may fall apart
7225,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Run a little small I love how soft these are and the fit. They do run pretty small so I wish I would have sized up.
7226,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Ssucked Didn't fit right anywhere.  Definitely compressed nothing!  Cheap material
7227,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Need to know it's not for curves To small for a XXL it feels like a large I believe it's not for curvy  women
7228,3,B0B16Q1854,0,They also shrink after wash. Run small.
7229,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Unflattering Very cheap fabric, did not hang properly on my body."
7230,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"No Stretch! The description says the dress has ""some stretch"" but the dress has zero stretch. It has a rayon look and feel."
7231,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,They were okay They started pilling the first wash. but they are cute
7232,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not good To small
7233,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,I was looking for a smaller sweatshirt as I am ... I was looking for a smaller sweatshirt as I am 5'3 100lbs but the arms were way too wide and it was way too short on my waist. Will be returning.
7234,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Was too small! I bought an xl This product was way too small on me
7235,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Large was too small for me I'm not a small person, but most large-sized clothing fits me fine. These were too small for my legs and fit more like leggings than joggers. Had to return."
7236,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Terrible quality and fake! So tired of cheap fake stuff on amazon. This is terrible quality and not at all worth the $20. Not worth $10 in fact. The image they‚Äôre using is from another shop and another dress. This is just a terrible knock off of that.
7237,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not as described I was not a fan. The material used is very slick. It was not compression but very loose and baggy. I wear size medium religiously and the mediums they sent me were to big and very baggy.
7238,1,B0928FSGGD,0,"Not comfortable The seams are very thick and stratchy, very uncomfortable for an undershirt."
7239,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Hahsb They run big and it's really loose but it's good for cold summer nights. Thank you for your time!!! (:
7240,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Wrong label! Have lots of these sweats. My go to. I'm old small guy. 5'7&#34; 118 lbs. In small these always fit and felt great, but this most recent one is way to large and long. Think label wrong. Small size maybe put on large sweatshirt."
7241,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"doesn't really look or fit like the photo Bought the blue one, doesn't really look or fit like the photo. Very thin material. Sadly had to return."
7242,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not for larger chested women Bought for my fiance and as she put it on it was tight till it reached her chest. It was far too tight. Wouldn't recommend for larger chested women
7243,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Order a size smaller Wayyyyy to big
7244,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS! The length of it only came midway if my calves, it is a way smaller fit, cheaply made. The only thing that they got right was, black, & the polka dots! üò≠üò¨üíî"
7245,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Full Zip Fleece Hoodie I got 2 different sizes from Prime Wardrobe to see which one would fit better.  The smaller one was too small and the larger one was way too big.  No luck with this brand anymore.  Had to return both.
7246,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"It does. It do what it‚Äôs described to do. I like the soft material. However, I would not recommend purchasing this item."
7247,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,There made smaller There a little tight
7248,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Good for Jiu Jitsu This is comfortable just a tad tighter than I was expecting, but then again they are not supposed to be loose."
7249,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not the color advertised I purchased this to wear while at a breast cancer walk. I wanted to make certain that I wasn‚Äôt to hot or too cold while walking. When it arrived I immediately noticed that it was not the color that was advertised. I picture shows a deep neon pink like a fuchsia. I received pink but not the one advertised.
7250,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Dissapointed Waited weeks and was patient with delays for this product, but was disappointed with the dress"
7251,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Very see through sadly I bought the red pair of these leggings, tried them on, and they are so dang see through."
7252,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Satisfaction I've seen it  cheaper on another site after I rec'd it, but I did save on the shipping.  It's a gift so I don't know about the fit."
7253,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Three Stars I should have gotten a size larger
7254,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not worth $30 maybe $10 I bought these yoga pants because of the reviews. Honestly, they are terrible. The fabric is rough and cheap feeling. Pulling them from the bag I realized two things this company said four way stretch? MAKE THEM STRETCH FAR. These were and large and by the sizing chart that should be conservative for my measurements‚Ä¶these could have fit a child. No thank you. Immediately returned."
7255,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,... away from the sweatshirt but other than that it's fine I bought about two weeks ago and my pocket is already ripping away from the sweatshirt but other than that it's fine
7256,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Nice style. Heavy, synthetic fabric Good fit. I am petite and XS fit well. The material is heavy and synthetic which made me feel hot and unventilated. Decent pants I wear to work as a chef."
7257,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Quality material but questionable sizing. I like the material of the shirts BUT they run a little on the short side. The black one and the navy blue one fit a little bit better than the gray one. I would definitely recommend ordering the next size up if available.
7258,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very disappointed They are see through and doesn't have cups ,so I returned them plus they where short and not very supporting"

Got two very different products, so I guess I'm doing two different reviews (edit: I cannot submit two different reviews, so I guess it will be  a two-parter).<br /><br />This is for the navy blue pair:<br /><br />First, the fit is weird. They are snug through the hips and thighs, but extra long. I have long legs, so I can wear them, but if you need a shorter inseam, they probably won't work.<br /><br />Second, the material is horrible. Really rough - like burlap. I washed them and used fabric softener hoping it was just sizing or something, but it isn't.<br /><br />I guess I will use these to work outdoors. They definitely aren't the comfy lounge pants I was hoping they were.<br /><br />Now for the mauve pair:<br /><br />Excellent fit, buttery soft material. I love these pants! Hard to believe they were sold in the same listing as the blue ones. I guess I will add a star since I can't review them separately. Whoever is doing quality control on this product needs to step it up a bit."
7273,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Short in the back & thin material but cute design. I wish that I had read the reviews more carefully as several pointed out that it is shorter than expected.  Judging by the picture of the model I thought this would be long enough to cover my behind but it is very short in the back.  I ordered a 3x to make sure it was large enough and it falls just at the top of my behind, but is longer in the front.  If I would have realized this I probably wouldn't have ordered it.  Also, the material is very thin, it is described as a cardigan, but the material is like very soft very thin t-shirt material and I expected it to be thicker since I think of a cardigan as a sweater type material.  It is a cute design though."

7275,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not compression tank tops Excellent service and quality. We were just looking for a compression fit that would help hold things in. These did not have that type of material at all. We‚Äôd also bought a size smaller. They were more like a wicking golf shirt material. If that‚Äôs what you need, it‚Äôs a great shirt."

Not small length wise but small as in it's dang near impossible to get it around the bicep area of the arms. I had multiple women try it on and they agreed. Even skinny women stated they were tight.
7288,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"1 size stretches to fit all? All are the smallest size it seems, but stretch out to the largest.  The bigger you are, the more skin tight it is.<br />That should be made more clear."
7289,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Dye bled on EVERYTHING I ordered the 3-pack white/gray/black in my size based on the sizing chart. They clung to my body but did not provide any compression. When the shirts arrived, the white shirt had odd dark stains across the front and one sleeve. I wore the black shirt for a day and the dye bled all over my skin and all of the other clothes I was wearing. I was able to figure out from this that the dark stains on the white shirt were the result of the black shirt bleeding on it in the package. The dye did not wash out of the white shirt, nor did it wash out of the other clothes that I had worn with the black shirt. It also stained my skin for a few days. I returned the shirts for a refund, but it seems like nothing can get the dye out of my other clothes."

Fits more like a regular t shirt. Not thick enough -no scrunches anywhere so not sure what its suppose to hold? Maybe the lines on the arm area (which is a joke). Someone mentioned the name needs to be changed and I agree- everyone that bought it for under their SCRUBS seem to love it so that could be a better fit."

I had read other reviews saying that their leggings did not turn out to be the same as the reviews here so that might be my situation right now. I was expecting soft yet supportive leggings but mine came in smaller than I expected and also shorted than I had expected.

7391,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"seam down the middle of the front The seam for this dress was right down the front, based on where the tag is and how the pockets are sewn in, which makes it pretty much unwearable. I'm returning it.  Could have been a fluke, but I personally didn't like the pattern that much in person either so I'm not going to bother reordering."
7392,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"cheap Two of the tanks started falling apart in the wash, very flimsy, thin material."

7394,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Smells like it‚Äôs been worn. Ordered ‚Äúnew‚Äù came in a plastic ziploc bag. Smells like someone wore them, ran a few miles, wiped their armpits with them and then shove them in a plastic bag and shipped out."
7395,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheap Fabric is cheap.  Nothing Compression about them.
7396,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not squat proof I wanted these to be a replacement for gymshark and they just are not. They are not squat proof and they run small. If you have hips or a butt order a size up and if you're working out in them, just order gymshark."
7397,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Two Stars these tops ran small. and shrank.
7398,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Inaccurate descriptions and sizing Initially I had given this a 3 star rating. I got about what I expected at this price point: below average quality for below average price. I just needed a brown hoodie in a short notice.<br /><br />But I lowered it to 2 for the reasons below:<br /><br />- They advertise this ‚ÄúNu-blend‚Äù fabric to be ‚Äúanti-pilling.‚Äù It pills. It‚Äôs nothing special. It‚Äôs a 50/50 blend. It is going to pill just as much as, if not more than, other cotton/poly blends. I didn‚Äôt realize they advertised anti-pilling when I first bought it, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised when it did. But coming back and noticing that advertisement made me feel like I should let others know that their ‚Äúanti-pilling‚Äù is a marketing ploy.<br /><br />-Jerzees sizing chart is inaccurate. The Large is advertised to be 29‚Äù from the highest shoulder point on the back. But after measuring it‚Äôs only 27‚Äù. That‚Äôs a pretty significant deviation when measuring in inches. It‚Äòs incredibly short. But also the waistband is tight relative to the rest of the hoodie, so it will pull any other shirts up with it. So expect a constant battle of pulling it down.<br /><br />I wouldn‚Äôt have taken away their 3 stars if their descriptions were accurate.<br /><br />For context: I‚Äôm a 25 y/o male. 6‚Äô0‚Äù tall. A lean 190 lbs. My normal size is L in tops. I wear my hoodies for casual streetwear or comfort. I prefer high quality with minimal branding and neutral colors. The sweatshirts/hoodies I buy typically range from $40-100."
7399,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Fabric feels awful Like wearing stretchy plastic. Not remotely comfortable.
7400,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Returned! Although I liked the quality of the fabric and the way this dress hung on me, I couldn‚Äôt get passed how unflattering it was on me. I‚Äôm bottom heavy with hips.  My husband said it was ok, but I returned it."
7401,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Arms are too long I bought this to wear under medical scrubs. I hate them. The arms are way too long so its very bunched up. And no matter what I do it keeps riding up (and yes i have the correct size)
7402,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Don‚Äôt buy The dress I got looked completely different that the one pictured and the material was terrible and tacky looking
7403,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Have ordered these before and size was good. This time that was not the case Not true to size. Have ordered these before and size was good. This time that was not the case.
7404,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Very thin fabric, not flattering. I didn‚Äôt like this dress. I was planning on wearing this for fall with legging and boots but the fabric was too thin and the color was also now how it was shown in the pics. I got the blue one. It somehow makes you look boxy. Does not enhance your curves. I returned it."
7405,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Teeny Tiny Thin material and much smaller than expected - spend a little more on the better product.
7406,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Material not great For the price not so great the material is horrible see-through and I have tried to buy several dresses from different companies on Amazon and sadly Ross, target, Walmart, Costco has better quality and is way cheaper"
7407,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Three Stars Okay for the price, not heavy duty, it will shrink."

7409,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not Flattering Terrible quality very short not good fabric and not flattering at all
7410,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Stain product. The white shirt came stain with a big tan square on it.  Need to figure out how to return.
7411,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Very cheap fabric I didn‚Äôt realize it was hand wash only.
7412,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Cheap Material One wash and the black completely faded AND got this white fuzzy cast to the entire thing. Very disappointed.<br />I ordered larger than I needed because I didn‚Äôt want it to hug me and it is still pretty clingy.
7413,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,NOT squat proof I ordered these in black. They fit well and look good but they have the opaqueness of regular tights as soon as you bend over. As in you can see EVERYTHING straight through them. 0/10 recommend
7414,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars It looks good but it is too large
7415,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Wery pure quality Wery pure quality
7416,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Ok Hoodie the item tends to create a bulge in the stomach area.  I'm 5'7&#34; and 140...no belly but the hoodie bulges in the belly when zipped.  Gotta tailor better.
7417,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not great, feels low-quality Do not by if you are at all a slim individual. Hoodie bunches up a massive amount in the front."
7418,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Poorly made...pocket had a hole in it
7419,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not happy Cheap material.
7420,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Short Too short
7421,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"It's not very long, do not put in dryer. It fits as expected, but I am only 5'3"" and it sits above my ankle, so I wouldn't say it long, especially for taller people. And there is a seam right down the front that isn't aligned, but no seam down the back. Poor design. Otherwise, would have been a great but at half the price."
7422,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,EXTREMELY LARGE - more like a 3 XXX EXTREMELY LARGE - more like a 3 XXX
7423,2,B09M6X79V9,0,These tops are nice but didnt receive 3 There was only 2 tank tops in package...supposed to be 3
7424,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Two Stars too large to my hubby, and give it to the person with this size."
7425,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Terrible material. I worse this dress for one day and was so itchy from the fabric.  It looked and felt cheap.  I gave it away.
7426,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Size up This product runs really small. So make sure you size up. Definitely better options out there other than these. Not very stretchy.
7427,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not a fan Dislike
7428,3,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression Very cute and seem to be well made.  They lack compression.  I have to layer these tops due to lack of support  and sheerness.  Was hoping for some degree of compression.  I‚Äôm small busted and can not imagine wearing these without layering
7429,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"The description lies Bought from Joe's USA<br /><br />1. It is not branded as Joe's like described, it is Koloa and a Port Authority Hoodie<br />2. It is not 50/50 blend. It is 78% cotton and 22% polyester<br />3. The tye dye job isn't that great<br />4. The hoodie feels HORRIBLE<br /><br />I can get better things at a box store for cheaper when they are in season. For a little more, I can get a water resistant name brand, but my inner toddler was attracted by all the COLORS! Don't let your inner toddler win. DO NOT GET THIS. You will not get what you order.<br /><br />(And I doubt it 7.8-8 ounce since it's not made out of what it is supposed to be)"
7430,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Gave me a rash! This hoodie was fine and the color was perfect. Except it gave me a rash all over my arms!
7431,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Don't buy. No compression . Got these for my athlete at home. Absolutely no compression. Cheap. Thin. Keep looking.
7432,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Too short It was shorter in the front than I thought it would be. Strange fit.
7433,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Quality control issues Shirts are a good fit and breathable, but holy crap, quality control is lacking! Seems like each of the 3 shirts has something wrong with it, something I have to fix or sew. Hopefully seller can make this right or this is my last."
7434,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not bad Fit well with true colors but there is a seam all the way up the front. I wonder why the seam was not placed in the back. Love the pockets. Fabric is not stretchy or sheer.
7435,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Started fraying after one wear It is a comfy shirt, for running and barre, but not so much yoga as it just falls into your face. But it started fraying after one wear - which is fine given the price point."
7436,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not really what I expected. They aren‚Äôt as tight ... Not really what I expected. They aren‚Äôt as tight as I‚Äôd hoped.

7437,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Typical low quality. Sleave seam came apart after one wash Dissapointed in quality. Thin fleece around seam came apart. Item returned

7439,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Waaay small It's cute, but the biggest size they sell fits like medium."
7440,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Got too small My husband usually wears a large. 6ft 200lbs.. yet he had to order a 2xl in order to get the fit right
7441,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Fabric is very light and thin I like the style but the fabric was thinner than expected for a fall dress.
7442,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"What Has Russell Athletic Done? I've always worn Medium, but this sweatshirt is too large and it doesn't resemble Russell sweatshirts that I've purchased in the past.  I've always been a fan of Russell Athletic gear, but I guess I'll have to shop elsewhere for sweatshirts in the future."
7443,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Short in the crotch These look like the photo in terms of colors and design. They are thinner than I was expecting and they are usually short in the crotch. I bought a size larger than I typically wear because I know joggers are meant to be slim fit and I wanted more room. They are roomier in the ankle and calf but still a little tighter than I would like in the butt and thighs. The biggest issue is the crotch, I cant sit without exposing the top third of my butt. I only 5'9 so I dont require tall sizes. Even if I lost 20 lbs this would still be a problem. Got a good deal so I'll probably just give them away to a short relative or friend."
7444,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not comfortable by my standards I was searching for &#34;sweaters&#34; and this showed up.  It's got a interior which is the sweatshirt type (I guess &#34;fleece&#34;) material.  It also doesn't look very good on me.  So I returned it.
7445,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"not squat proof i‚Äôve bought these leggings in 3 colors and wanted a new pair so got a new color. for some reason the blue aren‚Äôt as compressing as my other pairs from the same brand, these are also more see through. i wouldn‚Äôt recommend for a leg day or cardio"
7446,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very loose! These are great tanks for sure! But to say they are compression tanks is stretching it.. ha! Listening to reviews I ordered a size smaller than usual, but they are still loose! I will definitely still wear them but they are not what I wanted when ordering compression tops!"
7447,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Runs short The shirts are ok but I feel like they run short. I got it to wear under my scrubs, but they wouldn't stay tucked in. One of my shirts came with the seams ripped on the right sleeve."

7449,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Cheap fabric feel Thin fabric. Not much more than a pocket a scarf. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again. Don‚Äôt waste your money on these.
7450,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Perfect for the money` This dress is super cute and comfy but it did show wear after just one time use. So if you looking for something long term, this dress isnt for you!! Other then that, its good for the money."
7451,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,I wish I could exchange and size up My gf told me to order a small bc her large was getting lose. The<br />Mediums have no give. I‚Äôm so confused. I missed the rerun window!
7452,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Strange pattern Definitely better on the model than in person. The pattern on the sleeves is really strange and it just looks like two broken sweaters stitched into one. Not crazy about it and had to return.
7453,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Really cheap, looks and feels like cheap bad quality. Bad cheap and cheesy.  I suppose the bargain should have been an indication of quality.  I followed the reviews and regret it."
7454,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"i am not happy at all too big , i ordered small size and still HUGE , i am not happy at all , i will donate this."
7455,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Very clingy I love the color. Do not like the fit. Very clingy.
7456,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not a support shirt No support at all
7457,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Too small and unfinshed edge Bought this shawl for my wife and had to buy it 2 sizes larger then what she normally wears due to what I would assume is considered Asian sizing and when we received it one of the sleeves was not hemmed, leaving just the raw edge of the material.  Over all the quality of the shawl was poor."
7458,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Terrific color. Head opening, a bit small. Terrific color."

7460,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,The size was to small To little in back
7461,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Falls apart These tops are comfortable but after one day of wearing them they fall apart. The trim came unsewn around the arm in less then 24 hours.
7462,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Trust the reviews. BIG. I thought I figured it all out. I read all the reviews. I figured that I'm maybe a bit bigger than some of the descriptions so the large would fit fine. I should have realized that nearly everyone writes about themselves in a flattering light. I'm no different, so take this with a grain of salt.<br />I'm 6'2&#34; 200lbs. Broad shoulders and arms, and pretty doughy everywhere else. The Large is too big. Not GIGANTIC, but I definitely would like it a lot more fitted. In particular, the width of the arms where they attach to the torso are very oversized. 2 feet in circumference, no exaggeration. Sleeve length is fine. Elastic cuffs keep them from dropping too much. Bottom hem hits 2-3 inches below my belt.<br />Thankfully, awesome Amazon provided me with a refund. I might try the Medium. MIGHT. But I feel like I'll need the torso of a Medium and the sleeves from a Small."
7463,3,B0B16Q1854,0,This pair ran big Pretty colors. Length great. A little big. Default in workmanship of material. Had tiny pieces of cotton throughout out the material.<br />Disappointed.  Bought 4 pair all same size andcone was too small.
7464,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,The dress itself is nice. I will need to return it though It's very sheer. The dress itself is nice. I will need to return it though.
7465,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,They are okay for working out. Outside of that nothing else it‚Äôs a muscle shirt It‚Äôs a tank top.
7466,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"2yr old put this together The patches on the sleeves looked terrible...threads sticking out in multiple places.  The pic is very flattering, however, the cardigan we received looked like a 2 yr old put it together.  Awful!"
7467,2,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Wouldnt order again Disappointed...got the three pack of black, white and gray size large as I am 6‚Äô3‚Äù 215. These are def not athletic fit and are cut really akward. The black is the closest to a large but the white and gray..are way too big. If I was to guess they are xl with large tags put on them. Ill wear at home gym but would not wear out in public...just really awkward fit."
7468,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Two Stars Ran about 2 sizes too small.
7469,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"it's a fine sweatshirt especially for ten bucks Very well made, but the size was a bit too big on me. More specifically, the shoulder seem was a bit too far down the sleeve. Then again, I'm picky about that kind of stuff. Otherwise, it's a fine sweatshirt especially for ten bucks."
7470,1,B0B16Q1854,0,False advertisement 3x is a med.  The entire item is not made to any size.  Legs are hugs hips an thighs and entirely too small
7471,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Great for a family get together! I love the way this fits my body
7472,1,B09M6X79V9,0,I do not recommend The material is so thin. I do not recommend
7473,3,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression The material was a little thin and did not compress enough. I returned them.
7474,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Very pretty colors but thin fabric Dress is advertised as a T Shirt Dresses Casual Swing Dress.  It was at least one size too small for the thin elastic fabric.  I ordered an XL as I wear the US size 14 fit but was still clingier than desired with the stretchy fabric
7475,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,not happy It is very thin material and not sewn well.
7476,1,B0B16Q1854,0,The material is not of great quality The material is not of good quality and itches your skin

7478,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Little different from the picture
7479,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Extreme disappointment I ordered the color ‚Äúcharcoal‚Äù... does this look charcoal to you? I feel deceived and my closest return location for this issue is 20 minutes away. Don‚Äôt count on getting what you ask for. Disappointed is an understatement.
7480,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Walmart Quality What I got in the mail, was the most disappointing product I‚Äôve ever purchased off Amazon.<br /><br />First off: the leggings were shipped in the clear plastic bag that normally comes inside another box. Deal-breaker? No, but certainly off-putting.<br />Immediately they reminded me of those cheap department store leggings from 2015 that you only wore under a skirt because they showed everything with stretch. The only compression I found was in the abdomen- the leg and hip fabric was thin and unflattering. So it makes sense that when I tried the squat test, these leggings failed miserably! Even just holding the fabric up, you could see strange, unattractive ripples in the material.<br />I don‚Äôt know if what I received was a major, yet one-off quality mistake, but this has been my second major issue trying this brand out. Suffice it to say I‚Äôm returning these and going back to my trusty Colorfulkoala leggings."
7481,2,B097RFTKJP,0,It‚Äôs okay Very clingy order a size up
7482,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Should be $10 For a little over $20 fabric feels very cheap
7483,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Not true to size Not true to size
7484,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Small.... Too small and short
7485,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Black one is of horribly low quality Grey and Red shirt fit well, Black one is of horribly low quality. Stitching over shoulders does not line up and opening for arms are uneven by 3 inches."
7486,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Bad The sleeves are too large
7487,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Rides up I ordered a large even though I am a medium. The tightness is fine but it rides up. I am constantly pulling it down. It needs to be longer for it to be a product worth buying again. Definitely get a size up if you are going to buy it.
7488,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cheaply made I ordered these to wear under sweatshirts as a second layer. Only received them on march 5, today is march 23, haven‚Äôt worn that much. Already has a hole in the seam. Very disappointed."
7489,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Eh not for me Not a fan but others might like them. They have a shiny spandex look which isnt the look I was going for. Didnt care for the drawstring waistband either.
7490,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Poor quality stitching aound the pocket Warm and comfy but poor quality stitching around the pocket. Started to come apart after just 1 wash.
7491,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend Definitely a different material than expected and fits a full size smaller also bunches up in weird places, very tight on the chest"
7492,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Not pleased. Not as pictured. Poor quality. Two different types of fabrics.
7493,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Warm light but shrink Good aspects...very light and warm..bad...shrank and drafty neck.
7494,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Muy mala calidad Muy mala calidad una puesta y se pone fea la tela
7495,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Kmart quality After reading all the rave reviews I ordered a 3 pack of these yoga tops. The material is like something from a kmart discount rack. Not at all what I was expecting after reading about the superior quality. Don't waste your money.
7496,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Man boobs welcomed I thought I‚Äôd look hot in these on my beach trip but I looked like a was wearing a oversized sports bra from the back. It held my boobs up but not what I was expecting.
7497,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Shrinks a lot  in body length with one wash It fit good when I received it. I ordered a large and I am 6' and 200 lbs. I washed it once on cold and dried it on low and now it's too short at the waste. Funny thing is the sleeves stayed the same length. I purchased this product because many reviewers said shrinkage was almost 0. I don't like my stomach hanging out when I lift my arms.
7498,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Room to grow Large is apparently in the eye of the manufacturer and the buyer.  I should have ordered a medium which didn't seem much smaller from their size chart.  Sleeves and chest are oversize for me, but the garment seems well made, and I'll keep it."
7499,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star I hate it.
7500,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Definitely not the same dress as shown Shown as ankle length in the photos, came to just below the knee...and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô6‚Äù. Definitely not the same dress."
7501,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Runs small, and short, but comfortable? This fits okay... it looked so long in the picture but it seems like for larger sizes they just made it wider (it's too short).. it's super comfortable but I'm glad I read the comments and decided to order 2 sizes larger then I normally wear. I wish people could make nice things for larger galls."
7502,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Vital 2.0 Black Marl The vital 2.0 black marl are very see-through when you bend over. Like extremely see-through that i couldnt show a picture. Its like an xray.... the legging material is very comfortable and soft but unfortunately cant wear in public. ü´£
7503,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Doesn‚Äôt fit tight like compression clothing should It just does not fit right the way you would expect compression clothing to fit. I normally wear a XL but I bought a large so it would fit right and it doesn‚Äôt fit right at all. Material is very thin.
7504,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Did not fit well. Poorly made.<br />Doesn't look as styled on picture. Not flattering.
7505,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Shoulder straps too long but can be fixed. Cute dress and very comfy.
7506,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Too expensive, for something that doesn't work. Not compression, Cheap, Wasted Money."
7507,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Disappointed I‚Äôd love to give these a 5 star because the ones that did fit were very comfy and perfect . However I bought 5 pairs and out of 5 pairs only 2 were true to size . The other 3 were considerably smaller than they were supposed to be . 1 pair that did fit were completely the wrong color than what I ordered . Disappointed .
7508,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,Thick material for running Comfortable and soft shirt but material feels too thick and heavy for long distance running and running on hot summer days

7511,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"So if you have A or B cups you will be fine. The top of dress runs small.  After wearing it for a day, I noticed the sides of the dress had ripped. So if you have A or B cups you will be fine."
7512,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Not long lasting i got one size bigger and it fits perfect its stretchy and moves with you. After about 2 months of having them the material is starting to get little beads and is super uncomfortable on the inside and then looks ratty on the outside
7513,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Large is not a large wears like an extra large I love the color but fits to big it wears like an extra large not a large all i wear is large so i ordered a medium assuming it will fit like a large or will give up on this product.

7515,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Sizing is definitely 2 sizes to small Went off the size chart and still did not fit properly
7516,2,B09M6X79V9,0,It‚Äôs okay Quality is good
7517,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Does not fit Like the shorts do not like the shirts don't fit Need A3X
7518,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,3x = boys 10/12 Bought 3x which normally is very huge on me. I wanted them for around the house. These shirts fit my second son who wears a 10/12 in boys. Only thing is the arms are slightly too long for him. Don't bother unless you are tiny.
7519,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"The dress would have possibly been great. Unfortunately The chest area is about 2 inches smaller then it says it is.  The dress would have possibly been great.  Unfortunately, to get to the point where everything fit it looked like a discombobulated tent down together with spare parts."
7520,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars to long for a little woman
7521,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Runs large 3 stars because they came quickly and were what I ordered but didn't fit.  My husband is a 2X and these 2x shirts were way too large for him.
7522,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"overpriced.. very pointy hood top, not good. funny looking! This hoodie looks very weird when the hood top is up. It is very pointy like a witches hat. I can see why the product photos above do not display a photo of the hoodie top up on the head. Veey funny looking hoodie hood top."
7523,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Not a 3x fitting Too small, doesn't fit a normal 3xl"
7524,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"Not as pictured. The product photo showed the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. The hoodie I received was pink and yellow tie-dye. NOT what I ordered."
7525,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression Not compression but nice tank top
7526,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"a bit larger than expected I've got two exactly like this, and they fit perfectly even after repeated washing, but this one seems oversized."
7527,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Tight Very little stretch  so they fit snuggly.  Need larger sizes.
7528,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Is a little baggier than I expected. Might try to order a size smaller next time
7529,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star This hoodie has a bad stitching. The zipper at the abdomen comes out as if someone has pot belly.
7530,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Fitting The black one fits too small. The red and grey fits perfectly
7531,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Not as it appears in the photo Just like other reviews the model must be wearing one at least 2 sizes too big. It's not nearly as long as one would hope and the material is very thin. But you get what you pay for.<br />I'll definitely wear it because the colored sleeves are super cute but I would never order another.
7532,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Not true to size I ordered a size larger than my size and it fits as if i ordered a small for a teen. Had to gift it out to another person. But very pretty garment.
7533,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Sizing is off To small. They do not fit as expected. Order up!
7534,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Really Small If you live in the US, then be aware, you need to order at least two sizes larger.<br />Quality is fine, you get what you pay for, but be careful about sizing."
7535,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Made out of crap poor quality I ordered a medium size I got the one made for a giant To big big big crapola
7536,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Fits great Love them
7537,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"If you like being choked, then this is for you. waste of my money."
7538,3,B09M6X79V9,0,NOT a compression shirt! These are regular dry fit running or yoga tops. There is absolutely no compression or support to them. Very misleading as I purchased them for the compression. I‚Äôd otherwise rate it higher.
7539,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Would not recommend Cheap material
7540,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Not flattering The most awkward fitting leggings I have ever tried on. Returned.
7541,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not flattering Not very flattering<br />Fit was as expected
7542,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Not as expected... I bought this dress to wear for my birthday. It arrived quickly but upon opening found the dress to be defective. It has several faded or rubbed spots on the chest area. I washed it in hopes that it was just pressed from the store tag but it was not unfortunately. It‚Äôs unwearable and a complete loss.
7543,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Great product. It's what I wanted but a little too small , had to get the next larger size. also it stains easily and the stain won't come out.... product should be treated with something to prevent this from happening..."
7544,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,The color looks very different than in description The color looks very different than in description
7545,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Very unhappy with this purchase. This product came to my home in a shrink wrap bag. The wrinkles were so bad I could not possibly give this as a gift. Sadly I ordered three of them. And the sizes run so small none of them fit.
7546,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars No stretch in the material what so ever...my large chest looks a bit squished in the dress
7547,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Hole in pocket I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 109lbs and the waist fit me well and was a baggy fit. Be careful when ordering the plum color when I got my order I tried them on and there was a hole in the pocket /: like straight through the pocket to my leg it‚Äôs just weird but super comfy I would order again
7548,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Meh üòí Wouldn‚Äôt buy again! Would have better results making it on my own
7549,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Tight on top but lose on stomach They're OK, just OK. They are night and tight on the top but that is all."
7550,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Don't stay up well These pants don't clinch well at the waist. I find myself pulling them up constantly.
7551,1,B09M6X79V9,0,They were not compression Too big and were not compression
7552,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,It's nothing like the picture It's nothing like the picture. It shorter in the front and longer in the back. I would def have to wear toghts under because it's more like a high low dress thank what's pictured here.
7553,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"What?!? In the photo online it looked like there was a tech issue because some of the flowers were completely white, like it didn‚Äôt get printed correctly. Well, that‚Äôs exactly how it looks in real life as well! It‚Äôs like when it was being printed some of the flowers just got left off completely. It‚Äôs very bizarre and does not look good!"
7554,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too short too short...returning
7555,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Too big The sizes run large. Mine arrived and it‚Äôs way too big for it to work
7556,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Great quality.  Runs big though.
7557,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Very Tight in the Chest Pretty Dress üëó Okay Quality. The fit was very tight in the chest! I would recommend ordering one size larger than you normally wear.
7558,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Would NOT recommend!! The quality of the material is fine, and I ordered my actual size I wear which is medium and that's fine, but they are short Once you put them on the shirt fell just below my chest.  WHAT! Who would wear a running shirt that falls just below your chest?  Not me!  They got returned as quick as they came in"
7559,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not as expected Not a compression fit as expected.  Will be returning.
7560,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Smaller than expected, rides low Didn't fit right low rise.. uncomfortable"
7561,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Fits as expected Product could be more supportive in the mid section
7562,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not what I expected It‚Äôs just not like the old ones. This one doesn‚Äôt have tummy support. The band is weirdly at the top of the tummy compressing lower tummy. Seller said to contact them if you have complains but never heard from them for weeks. I bought three and I‚Äôm returning them all.
7563,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Two Stars Very bulky in the arms and tight around the waste. I look like a big balloon!
7564,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"They fit shorter than I'd like. I am 5'8"" and 153lbs They fit shorter than I'd like. I am 5'8&#34; and 153lbs. They fit great around my body. I just wish they were a bit longer."
7565,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Too big It was way to big
7566,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Too Small Way way too small and I ordered XXL and usually wear medium to large
7567,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Neleus Long sleeves Shirts fit smaller than I thought they would be.
7568,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Flimsy Material I wear this dress with leggings.  You can dress it up or down.  However,  the fabric is very flimsy. And there are no pockets. I knew that when I bought it, but pockets are sorely missed here."
7569,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Joggers thinking they are leggings.... It‚Äôs like leggings meet joggers. Very odd mixture. Legging material, but baggy in the thighs... just not flattering AT ALL."
7570,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Nope... This dress is poorly made and only slightly resembles the picture.
7571,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not what was expected Run somewhat small, tend to ride up while wearing them. Seams are not straight down the side. Overall not what I anticipated based on description and images"
7572,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"1/3 had an issue but fit well 1 out of 3 shirts in the package came with a snag in the fabric. The material is similar to a basketball jersey feel. I wish it was softer and I wish all three shirts came without issues. Other than all that, they fit fine."
7573,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Sizing ran larger than chart indicated! Was a little to large, although size chart indicated they would fit right. Also a little cheaper material than the Teslo brand I usually purchase."
7574,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Holes is the fabric This is the second package I have ordered. The first was perfect. The second however was not. I pulled the red out of the package this morning and pulled it on to find tiny holes all in the side. The other two appear to be fine but this one is ruined. I will be returning.
7575,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,too large Much larger than expected.
7576,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,No Good Fits weird. Got these for working out and the material is not what I expected. Don‚Äôt like em at all
7577,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Great if you order one size down Can't beat a sweatshirt like this for 10 bucks! I like the materiel not too thick not super fuzzy. I really should have trusted the reviews and sized down to a medium, but it was double the price!"
7578,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Waistband is disproportionately small/too tight I was excited to get these to use for work but they are way more marled than I understood from the photos and they also have a weirdly tight waistband compared to the tightness of the pant. I have a small waist so I expected it to fit fine but honestly it's wayyy too snug and looks unattractive leaving me with a stomach bulge over and under the waistband. I went on a whim buying these and they did not fit my expectations.
7579,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Three Stars Material is a bit thin for compression style, well made."
7580,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Ok It wasn‚Äôt what I expected other than that it‚Äôs fine just not for me
7581,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Poor quality After the first wash the dye came out of the fabric leaving it looking 5 years old. Terrible quality. Sending back.
7582,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Roll down... I wanted to love these because of the compression and lovely color, unfortunately the leggings roll down and do not stay up. I ordered a small about 150lbs, 5' 1""."
7583,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Too small I ordered an extra large to make sure I could wear them. They fit my 8 year old Grandaughter.
7584,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not the same color as the pic Didn‚Äôt even try it on. Not hair with the color. I‚Äôm sending it back
7585,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Disappointed This isn‚Äôt a sweater cardigan at all. Not knit. Just cheap printed fabric. Not like pictured at all.
7586,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Doesn‚Äôt meet my expectations I‚Äôd like to return Doesn‚Äôt meet my expectations I want to return
7587,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Nice for summer There is a seam down the middle front and no seam on the back. Should‚Äôve reversed that.
7588,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Poor quality Very poor quality. Rough on skin. Too short, tight in chest. Not at all like picture or description."
7589,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Wasn‚Äôt satisfied! They were ripped/torn on the right side
7590,1,B009R09Z8W,0,One Star Picture doesnt show good clearance
7591,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Terrible The material is weird and the fit is tight. Not good at all.
7592,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Way too small Too small and I was really looking forward to wearing this
7593,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Ripped Ripped at the arm stitching after 2 uses.
7594,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Scratchy, Runs Small, Color Not As Expected I fell in love with the color on the ad. However, when the pants arrived I was disappointed to say the least. The color is dull, ok I guess I could live with that, but the worst part is the fabric is not at all soft as you'd expect from a pair of sweatpants. I'd have been better off buying a pair of Hanes from WalMart. Basically you're paying for the brand name. But the quality is subpar."
7595,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Shirt too big My son ordered this shirt and found it way too  large for the size.  He usually wears a medium, but this one looks like a X-large to him.  I tried to wash and put in a dryer and hope it will shrink.  It did nto shrink too much.  So if you like this style, order one size down."
7596,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Sleeves are super short. I am a true size small and the arms on this shirt are about 4 inches too short.
7597,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Beautiful dress, poor material The dress is beautiful, flattering, and so comfortable. The fabric is so soft and so breathable. Right off the bat, I thought the fabric was a little thin, and you could definitely see the line of my bra, but I just made sure to wear a dark red bra to match. You can't even sneeze on this material without it discoloring. Literally a raindrop hit it and it changed colors. I also didn't think much of it, I figured when it dried it would look normal, not the case."
7598,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Run small 2x feels like a large Run small<br />2x feels like a large
7599,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"use as an underlayer Thinner fabric than I expected.  Can't be worn alone, but fine as an underlayer."
7600,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Uncomfortable and short. Can't tuck in. Rides up my little tummy.
7601,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars The right pocket just came apart from the jacket over time.
7602,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Mine came with a hole in it! Very disappointed! Customer service never communicated with me. Very disappointed in this product and seller!
7603,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Very  poor quality This first time I put it on the seam came completely unraveled. These aren‚Äôt the quality I was looking for in a tank and I would not recommend them.
7604,1,B097RFTKJP,0,It doesn‚Äôt look as good as the picture Looks cheap. Not flattering.
7605,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"love the dress but poorly made or mine was super ... I wore this twice and then went to was it and the strap ripped right in half, it was on the gentle delicate cycle, love the dress but poorly made or mine was super faulty. I bought it in February waiting for spring summer but now I have to try and fix it or buy again. Be super careful upon washing."
7606,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Great material but pointy shoulders‚Ä¶ I usually get the hanes brand crewneck for work and decided to try the russel brand since it arrives faster through prime. Decent crewneck nothing special except i don‚Äôt know if it was just mine but the shoulder inseam sticks out a lot ‚Ä¶ I wonder if it will go down after some washes but if it doesn‚Äôt it will probably be used for the gym. I weight 200lb 6ft and got a size L
7607,2,B09M6X79V9,0,cheap material the material feels cheap. there is no built in bra and overall not a fan. I wore one to check it out to confirm i didn't like it. I didn't. I feel like it will also hold smells in the material after many wears (bo/soap/deoderant smells). Just keep an eye out for that.
7608,1,B09M6X79V9,0,If you wanted a built in bra this isn't for you. I would have given it a 5 Star the fabric is nice with just the right amount of stretch. I did order a bigger size seeing that they seem to run small. I gave it a 1 Star because I was lead to believe it had a built in bra.<br />That's really too bad because I really wanted to like this Razor tank.
7609,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Order 2 sizes up if you have hips and thighs I'm 5'4 and about 155lbs. I ordered an XL and they were tight and every time I bent over my butt crack showed. I normally wear a large in bottoms cause I am pear-shaped but reading the reviews I decided to go up a size. NOPE!!! Go up 2 if you like them comfy and somewhat loose. Will be returning and not reordering.
7610,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Sleeves are different lengths. I purchased this shirt to layer  underneath my nursing uniform.  I like the material and the colors. Unfortunately one shirt had sleeves that were different lengths.  The other shirt, the sleeves were too short."
7611,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not the compression material I thought it would be Good price just not the compression material I was looking for.  It‚Äôs looser than expected.  I have other compression tanks and these don‚Äôt come close to smoothing out anything. Okay as a tank top under a button up. But not as a single tank top I would wear to workout in.
7612,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars NEED MORE SIZE'S AND WAS'NT THE RIGHT COLOR
7613,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Regrets Not what I expected.
7614,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"The fit is good, The stitching is not The fit is good, The stitching is not. There are holes in both pockets and a few loose seams. I sew so it will be easy for me to fix. Just an FYI."
7615,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Super cute dress Super cute dress however the fabric is starting to show signs of wear after four uses.
7616,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Low quality & loose arms Low quality & loose arms
7617,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Two Stars Not for the big busted
7618,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars real comfortable but i ordered an XL and got an XL but it fits like a 3XL
7619,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Cute but not compact Not compact at all. Yes it fits and looks very nice but it's also thin. Price is good for 3 tops
7620,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Mala compra, es mejor comprar personalmente estas cosas Un pantalon no acorde con lo que se requeria, se ve muy ordinario las costuras hacia el exterior, queda todo suelto y ancho, nos dimos cuenta que comprar ropa no vale la pena hacerlo por Amazon."
7621,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Too Large!!! It is too large to wear especially on the armpit area. The lenght of the sleeves it too long. Please note that I usually wear Large, but even though I ordered Medium size basing on others review it is still too large for me."
7622,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Sizing is off I ordered a size medium, but they don‚Äôt all fit the same."
7623,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Two Stars DID NOT LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOK ON ME SENT BACK TO SELLER WITH NO PROBLEMS
7624,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Pretty to look at pretty to touch....FIT, not so much! The product runs small and really isn‚Äôt a deal. Just kinda cheap feeling and sleeves are short. Sorry. Colors are pretty but doesn‚Äôt fit. Sometimes deals just aren‚Äôt deals."
7625,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Really comfortable but started pilling after a couple of washes They were perfect at first but after 2 washes they began to pill and get scratchy. They are still wearable but not nearly as comfortable or attractive as they were at first. They are comfortable still but certainly look a bit rougher. With that being said, it didn‚Äôt stop me from buying another pair."
7626,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Awful I dont like them they dont stay in place
7627,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Don‚Äôt buy it! Horrible fit
7628,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Great but do not dry If you put these shirts in the dryer they shrink down 1-2 sizes the first set I got not no longer fits
7629,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars ok but you pay for it
7630,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,sleeves are oddly proportioned the sleeves on my sweatshirt are really odd...If the small sweatshirt was designed for someone with 30 inch biceps and 5 inch forearms then I would have no complaints.  But I really don't think that is what Russell intended.
7631,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Made in Pakistan. The sizes on here aren't what you get. Made in Pakistan.
7632,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars These were nice but the were huge!
7633,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not as expected Hoped for stronger compression. This is very thin and feels like a camisole.  Ordered to use for post surgery to reduce fluid in my torso.  Not going to get the job done with these.
7634,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,I washed it and it fits a little better. The zipper is a little hard to make ... I washed it and it fits a little better. The zipper is  a little hard to make a connection some time's.
7635,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Two Stars Too tight around the neck
7636,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Wrong color I ordered a pink but got orange, was disappointed but not returning it incase someone else will want it."
7637,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"WAY too small, pick another brand I wear an XS in leggings, joggers, most all clothing. Was recommended to buy an XS in this product but I wanted a baggier fit so I opted for a S. They‚Äôre skin tight, like exactly the same fit as leggings.<br />Poor sizing aside, the material is strange and has weird restricting seams on the waistband.<br />Pick another brand"
7638,1,B097RFTKJP,0,cheap The photo of this dress makes it look a little bit dressy. I was disappointed when i got it out of the package and saw the material it is made with. It does look like Halloween costume material. It was too loose up top and fit rather snug on the rest of my body. I will return for a refund.
7639,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not well made. These were much smaller and thinner than expected. Wouldn't order them again.
7640,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Easy to return Did not as desired
7641,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression at all Product is not as described.  No compression at all.
7642,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Constant ride up Oh nope to slippery don‚Äôt stay down felt sloppy don‚Äôt use them for sure not getting more
7643,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Three Stars daughter likes the dress but very thin for my taste
7644,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Handwash them. The beautiful US Polo Association does not hold up well in a dryer or the machine for that matter. Hand wash them or the lettering will melt off, leaving a yellow hint of the design."
7645,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Junk Cheap junk. Really dissapointed in these. Nothing at all like the pictures. Throwing them away.
7646,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Ok but not great Not what I expected.
7647,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheap material. Not compressed at all! Will not buy again.  Don‚Äôt waste your money!
7648,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,I got shorted one shirt I ordered a three pack but only two pieces game in the delivery
7649,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not very warm It‚Äôs not very warm no warmer than a basic sweatshirt
7650,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Super tight So these thermals are NOT cotton thermals. I wear Med but got the large and it‚Äôs still tight. They‚Äôre not soft. I‚Äôm just not pleased with them.
7651,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"There was a small hole on one of the shirts, disappointed :(  "
7652,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Small & uncomfortable Material is very scratchy against the skin.
7653,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"no stretch at all this dress is very cute but it has no stretch at all. I thought with the 5% spandex this would have good stretch. If you are very busty this may be a tough fit. This dress fit me everywhere but it was VERY tight in the bust. Ordered the XL and I am usually a  16/18. Will probably return or give it to my daughter. I am 5'7"" and the length was good. Disappointed because it is a nice style."
7654,2,B076QD9NP1,0,Too small - used their size guide! I used their size guide and it was still too small.  My daughter is normally a size 6 on most brands (she is 5).  I went down a size because of their size guide and it fits her like a size 4.  Returning.  Will just shop at a local store.  Wasn't that impressed with the quality.
7655,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"but thy are comfortable, I bought these foe my gf, and a she said thy fit small, but thy are comfortable,"
7656,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Size matters Product is cute, but last minute I ordered a larger sale ez because my gut said so and I'm glad I did because it would have been too small ordering my typical size"
7657,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Inaccurate sizing Not even close to the size it's supposed to be.
7658,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Three Stars Fits a bit smaller than u would think
7659,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Low Grade Fabric While the dress looked and fit as expected, the fabric was low grade."
7660,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Very very thing fabric Opening the bag, I was greeted with an obnoxious smell.  The fabric was extremely thin.  That was it for me...back into the bag and returned.  Do not recommend - at all!"
7661,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Different than picture The material and the cut of the dress is different than what's pictured
7662,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Thin but fits as expected. Very thin.  I thought it would be thicker since it is long sleeved.  Fits as expected. I am 5' 4"" 155 lbs and ordered a medium."
7663,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Shirts are great when they send the size u ordered They sent me the wrong size. But these shirts do fit and feel great. When u finally get ur right size
7664,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Cheap and Poor Fit This looks NOTHING like the image. I actually don't even think it's worth 1 star. The fabric is so thin it's almost see-through and the fit/cut is just terrible. Makes me look about 10 lbs. heavier. Just keeping it to sleep in, but I wouldn't have even spent $5 on it had I known."
7665,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Not 100% satisfied Great fit, but the seams popped on the sleeves almost immediately."
7666,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not as expected Too small and the fabric was not stretchy
7667,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Thought these had bra's built in, they DON'T!!!!! These are not for working out if you have boobs.  No support.  They look like they have built in bra's but they don't."
7668,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Sleeves are huge, front is short and weird. Doesn't seem to fit a normal human properly. The sleeves are too long and big, and the front is very, very short. It's just wonky all the way around. I was so looking forward to this, but unfortunately it's too weirdly shaped and sized for me to wear it."
7669,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"They pill They came a little bit pilled, and the material started to fall apart the first time I wore them. Its a shame because they are flattering."
7670,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Size up! Very pretty, little small on top. Gave it to my neice. Looks great on her!"
7671,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not comfortable Not comfortable doesn't really help messes with your posture.
7672,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Mens medium? Great color, good fabric.. However a men's medium should fit a little bigger on me  am disappointed.  Sure won't put it in the dryer."
7673,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Shallow pockets I bought two of these I did not realize the pockets were so shallow my phone doesn't really fit in it medium sized phone. On one of them the pocket is becoming unstitched I do like the feel of it though and it's just the right weight.
7674,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No support...more like a tank top Not enough spandex to do the job I had hoped for.  Very basic tank top.  Not what I wanted.  Was looking for tummy control and a bit of support...didn't get it.
7675,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Fell apart night one How embarrassing. The first night I wore this the strap broke. It wasn't tight at all, just fell apart. And the worst part was, I didn't notice until I got home. You get what you pay for."
7676,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Runs too small I read the measurements and would fit a large and wanted a size bigger to move in smoother so I went xl and def not a us xl. 5‚Äô7 at 180 and this shirt cuts just below the belt and has no flow just tucks against the skin at an xl. Runs Too small for its shirt type designed to be loose.
7677,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Cheap quality Did not care for the material the pants were made of. The design was so unflattering on me.  The quality was not what I would expect for the price.
7678,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression It‚Äôs definitely not compression. I‚Äôm 9 months pregnant and would need a small for it to feel like ‚Äúcompression‚Äù
7679,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Epic failure Sooo dissappointed with most clothing ordered off Amazon. If you run size 6-8 order Large or even XL or product will be skin tight w little give. Strap on one side (untied that you have to knot) is actually what keeps the dress up, you have to adjust it, just doesn‚Äôt hold up well. Looks amazing online, fails in person"
7680,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not true to size. i bought an xlg and it fits like a medium.
7681,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Not the best ever. I thought they felt and looked cheap. Waist is tight and I am not excited to wear them. Hate it. I was so looking forward to these. I have a feeling they will be too hot in summer and too thin for winter. If I had not washed I would return.
7682,1,B009R09Z8W,0,One Star Terrible not soft and cozy!!!!!!!!!
7683,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Runs big This runs big, suggest going down one to two sizes"
7684,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star The area around the arms is way too large. I will never get this type of dress again
7685,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Not happy Sleeves too long, the back way too short. Not happy."
7686,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Like a busted can of biscuits I have several 2xl compression shirts from different companies but I have never in my life tried on a 3xl that made me feel more like a busted can of biscuits than these made me feel. It was like trying on a Xl or a large. I could barely breathe it was so damn tight. 10/10 would not recommend
7687,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,Extremely thin material Shirt is paper thin. A few washes and this will fall apart - hence the price.
7688,2,B0928FSGGD,0,They are ok One fit perfectly however the other two (the same size) were much tighter
7689,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,top of Dress is not Cut Right i bought a large and when this dress came the dress top is cut too small.. the top of the dress is made for a small and the body of the dress is made for a large.. very disappointing and i am returning it..
7690,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Ok I bought it for my bf. it is a little big for a medium! Maybe it'll shrink after a few washes and be the perfect size? But it's okay.. Just a regular sweater!
7691,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Arrival extremely late Product fit nicely,  but not like picture shows. A little misleading.<br />Only complaint is I ordered April 2nd so I would have by vacation May 15th... dress kept getting pushed out arrived May 15th after we already had left for the week..... very disappointing since I did want it for my vacation...."
7692,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Ehhhh These are nice but clearly made by a man with no butt. They are a significantly lower waist line then it appears in the picture. Plus one of the medal circles that surround where the draw string comes out of the pants popped off the first time I wore them. Overall they are comfortable but you need to make sure you wear them with a longer shirt.
7693,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Expected compression. All it is is a nice quality tank top. Runs bigger no compression at all. Nice quality material. Was hoping from some compression so I did not have to wear a sport bra under it, but no such luck. Runs big. Ordered a medium should have ordered an extra small to get any compression or support."
7694,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Had mold all over them Smelled and had mold on them
7695,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Cheap and uncomfortable Ordered x-large but these are so tight they are uncomfortable.  Had to order some others can't wear these.
7696,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Sizes are way too small! Sizes are very small. The large is smaller than any medium I have worn.
7697,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Comfort but fits large Dress is good quality but material is thin. Red color is vibrant and garment is very soft. Runs large, I am size 8 and usually go for size L when ordering on line. I ordered size M this time per reviews. I should had ordered size S, it is big. Not a dress for the office because material is thin, good dress for a day off or best as sleeping gown because is so soft."
7698,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,not as compression as i wanted. Wanted a compression around my stomach and chest but just more of stretchy material then compression so doesnt do much.
7699,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Look elsewhere Poor quality and the fit is uncomfortable
7700,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Loose and lightweight My boss is recovering from the same breast cancer I had and recommended these shirts for compression to help with my lymphedema. Unfortunately, I ordered my usual size and found them very loose and lightweight‚Äîplain old spanx has SO much more compression. This is particularly weird to me because I‚Äôm pretty well-endowed and am used to things in my size running a bit tight; you‚Äôd think compression garments would be on the tight end, too. Not compressive at all; I‚Äôd wear this for a comfortable relaxing or running shirt any day I‚Äôm feeling overstimulated, though. Cut seems fine and proportionate and the fabric is nice.<br /><br />Size reference: I ordered L. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8, 170lbs, 34FF bra, 31 inch waist.<br /><br />Pros: breathable, lots of color choices, seams aren‚Äôt bothersome, has some stretch<br />Cons: lightweight, not too compressive by my standards, runs large"
7701,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Seams Don‚Äôt have a photo of me in the dress just yet. Love the material and the dress the major complain I have is the seam in the front and the polkadots don‚Äôt line up. Thankfully it‚Äôs comfortable wear backwards that the seam is less noticeable that way.
7702,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Queda perfecto, pero no llego en el color esperado No me agrado el color, el color seleccionado era blanco y lleg√≥ gris"
7703,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars a little thin but ok for summer workouts
7704,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not the same print and not long enough for me. I was going this was going to be longer and draped better.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 180 and the fabric was not that soft and the latter had huge white polka dots.  Didn‚Äôt look like the one in the image.  It wasn‚Äôt long enough for me, nor did it have the look I was going for, so I sent it back."
7705,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Way Too Thin These are a nice fit and style but they are soooo thin, especially the white one.  I had to send these back because there is no way I would ever feel comfortable wearing these out in public."
7706,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Short length Too short! If you want to tuck them in it‚Äôs not happening.
7707,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Nice hoodie but cuff wear fast Nice hoodie however I have had this item a very short time just days and the cuffs are already showing signs of wear. This is worrisome as a hoodie ought to have a longer life in good condition
7708,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"This fits fine in the chest but it's so long that it ... This fits fine in the chest but it's so long that it covers my butt. And I'm 5'8&#34;, so I'm not extremely short. I think I'd have to be at least 6'2&#34; for this to fit properly. Unfortunately, I've shopped and shopped in many stores, and every full-zip hoodie I've tried on has been too long, too, so I decided to keep this. I mostly only wear it around the house, for extra warmth in the colder months."
7709,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Stinky shirts The shirts Have a good quality fit good I really like the shirts but I do have an issue the ones I received were really stinky like armpits so somebody worn them before I got them
7710,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Large Very big
7711,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Super pretty but tight for a big bust This dress is really pretty and fit great except for the bust. Just a bit too tight for my big bust. If you're not lugging around a couple of cannons, I'd imagine this would be an essential piece in the summer. Also doesn't have a built-in bra which is a big plus in my book."
7712,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Three Stars Material is cheap, but price is good"
7713,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Russell Athletic Mens Hoodie Made too big for the size I ordered
7714,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression Terrible quality. Do not recommend. As others have said - no compression.
7715,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Nice jacket. Bad zipper I've had it for about a month now. Perfect for the spring weather. That is until the zipper teeth broke in 3 spots. They werent sewn in too well and fell apart. Now it won't zip back up. Therefore a waste of 30$. Just buy a pullover.
7716,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Two Stars Way smaller than suggested
7717,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Color This product was really really vibrant, where as in the picture it was a bit more pale, still a comfy hoodie, just wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you want a pastel hoodie. (:"
7718,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,One Star They are obviously not measuring adults. If I could give no star
7719,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Rides in the crotch area Great color and material but rides and gives you camel toe. Don‚Äôt do it.
7720,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Tight in the Neck I was too difficult to get my head through the top.The neck of the Hoodie was too small.
7721,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Fleece Crewneck. This sweatshirt is TOO BIG.  Sleeves are baggy.  Shoulder seams are too low on the arm.  Not very flattering.  Had purchased this as a Christmas present.  Wish I could return it.
7722,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Como ropa interior esta bien; como blusa para hacer ejercicio no tiene bastante spandex. Me hubiera gustado que hubiera mas spandex.<br />Se siente mas como nylon.
7723,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Very dissatisfying! Material is too thin and ferls so cheap....almost like a plastic feeling but thinner version
7724,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not very comfortable. It rides up and bunches around my waist.
7725,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Thin material Like the fit and color.  Just the material is too thin. See through.
7726,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Cut small These are cut small and are not 88 % polyester and 12 % spandex.
7727,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,that it's going to fit. I like the colors.  I can never get the right size. Every brand seems to be different in my size. One of my shirts came inside wrapped in a plastic bag. The other two were not. It made me wonder if they returns.
7728,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Why is there a seam in the front and not EVEN CENTERED?!?!?! I would've given this 5 stars if it weren't that the seam is off to the right side in the front. It looks like a first time seamstress made this where it looks fine on a hanger but on an actual person the whole thing is messed up. I'm really upset with this purchase. I got the right size and everything. I won't be purchasing from them again.
7729,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Disappointed These fit right everywhere but the waist and they‚Äôre so cute it‚Äôs very disappointing :( for reference I am 5‚Äô2 and 105lbs. I ordered the XS. Will be returning
7730,1,B07XD71F1H,0,No good No me gustaron ninguno parecen de vieja
7731,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Nice shirts, Terrible sizing. Nice shirts.<br />Good quality.<br />Absolutely the worst sizing I‚Äôve ever experienced. 85%?of my shirts are XL,  fit a bit loose.<br />So I ordered XL.<br />Opened up the bag looking forward to wearing.<br />DAMN!!! Har to fight it on.<br />Long story short.... the XL I received are smedium‚Äôs.<br />I‚Äôd go as far as smalls. My skinny 17 yr old just got some shirts<br />Order 3X maybe 4x if your large or XL.<br />NICE SHIRTS THOUGH!!!<br />Sizing sucks!!"
7732,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too small I normally wear a large. It said to order up. I ordered a 2XL and it was still tight. REALLY?
7733,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Print is off So this is a cute dress and was flattering on me.  However, the print did not match along the seam in the front.  It did match along the seam in the back.  I tried it on backwards to see if that would work but it didn‚Äôt.  I am not overly picky, but I would rather have a mismatched seam in the back than the front.  An obvious mismatched seam makes it look like it was cheap - as it is.  The goal is to take an inexpensive dress and style it so you can‚Äôt tell.  This missed the mark."
7734,3,B09M6X79V9,0,false advertisement not compression tanks at all. Thin material
7735,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Short in back Sleeves fit well , however the back of the sweater is short"
7736,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small. Fabric is not breathable Not long enough
7737,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Very tight I always wear medium joggers, but these mediums fit like leggings on me. I kept them because the material is super nice, but if you‚Äôre looking for a lounge/workout jogger be warned these are very form fitting."
7738,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Size seems to be shifting I have always ordered this in large but now a large is larger than before... a warning would have been nice....
7739,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Very thin fabric I was looking for a swing dress like Old Navy usually has, and came across this. I was tempted to return it when it came but I thought maybe i should give it a chance. I'm not too happy with the fabric.... It's quite thin and nowhere like the Old Navy ones. When u wear the Old Navy swing dresses, they don't show too much of my ""rolls"" and it's flattering. This one on the other hand, shows every little dent and it's kinda ugly. I wear these casually so I don't want to have to wear a slimmer under it to smoothen my shape. Now that I've worn it i probably can't return it. If you're slim then I'm sure it'll be ok (still thin weak fabric)"
7740,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small Looks good but runs small I ordered a xl and usually wear a large and it was tight
7741,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"I ordered green per the picture but delivered was Navy ... I ordered green per the picture but delivered was Navy. Upon further inspection, the description says Navy but the picture is not even close to a Navy, it was very green."
7742,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Get what you pay for I had high hopes b/c I liked the pattern & style. However, it got returned. Pattern didn‚Äôt match up on the sides, flimsier fabric than I anticipated & the inside of the black dress is white which stands out when walking or sitting."
7743,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"light cotton dress, perfect for summer I thought it would be roomier, the pattern doesn't match up in seams, right up front.<br />comfortable anyway"
7744,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Two Stars Like the dress has a seam up the front that clearly is mismatched in alignment of pattern.
7745,3,B009R09Z8W,0,This is an okay sweatshirt This is an okay sweatshirt. It is kind of stiff when you get it. I have tried washing it to help make it less stiff and it seemed to help a little bit. The bottom of the sweatshirt is a little tight at the waste. It looks good but isn't the most comfortable sweatshirt. I would not describe it as soft and cozy.
7746,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Fit was fine color was not Color was not like the picture
7747,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars Had the wrong size label attached
7748,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"I usually get a large and with the med I got it felt like a large I bought a medium basing of the other reviews that the sweatshirts were a size bigger then what's ordered, which is true. I usually get a large and with the med I got it felt like a large, although I have a feeling this was designed for taller people, I'm 5'7 which is a bit on the short side but it was a bit too long. I'm starting to think I should have gotten a small. Other then that it's a good, warm, comfortable sweatshirt. I'm still going to wear it but just be aware to go a size smaller then what you are use to at least"
7749,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Disappointing This was a waste of money - faded the first time washed - never wore again! Disappointing!!!
7750,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too pricey for what you actually get Thin cheap material. Not compression at all. Feels like  cheap halloween costume material.
7751,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Busted my bubble! Oh no! I was expecting the fabric to be much thicker and the the x large to be 12-14. But that wasn't the case when I got it!<br />I will keep it and give it to someone smaller than myself.
7752,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Super see through! Before and definitely during the squat, you‚Äôre seeing skin through these. The material is super see through. I could see them being used as leggings under a dress or something, but they definitely don‚Äôt pass the gym requirements- too cheeky cheeky! Also, I‚Äôd size up if you really do want to get them, not much give to the material."
7753,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Cute but small It‚Äôs a cute dress but it‚Äôs small then the size measurements say
7754,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Sleeves are Ridiculously BIG Purchased size SMALL and the sleeves are big enough to fit a professional bodybuilder ... With room to spare.  Returned.
7755,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"You get what you pay for Thought this was a great price, and it really is- but it's a bit too good to be true, considering these are described as ""compression,"" which they are definitely not. I followed their size chart for my order, and these are somewhat loose-fitting. I'm keeping them, because they are comfortable and they look okay. But they are not the greatest quality, and they are absolutely not compression tops."
7756,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star I WANT A REFUND
7757,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Order a smaller one than the size chart might indicate I measured my body and ordered the XL size. According to the data image on the product page an XL compression shirt is the correct size to order for those with a chest measuring 39-41.5in. My chest measurment is 43 so I ordered XL expecting it to be very snug in the chest and a bit loose in the waist. It's a nice shirt that fits generally skin tight but it offers ZERO noticable Compression. I'm not unhappy with the fit but it's certainly not fitting like the compression shirt that I thought I was ordering would. I will probably exchange for the smaller size.
7758,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Cute but cheap fabric I like the design of this dress. It runs a little large, I normally would order a medium but kept the small. The fabric is soft and stretchy. My only complaint is that the fabric is poor quality. I washed it once and the black is already looking faded and slightly piled. If the fabric was better I would have rated this dress 4 stars."
7759,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"False advertising, unbelievably disappointing! Size on dress was wrong, sizes was advertised  completely for another style of dress.<br />It was extremely uncomfortable, unflattering, difficult to get in and out, the material smelled so weird and the coloring did not match the picture‚Ä¶at all! I had to give it a star, because it won‚Äôt let you continue with the rest. Otherwise, it would be a complete ZERO!"
7760,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"SEE THROUGH! I got these in the black marl color and although they fit really well, they are extremely see through!! I would definitely not be able to wear these out anywhere. Waste of money."
7761,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Thin and see through So thin, completely see through!!  Must pay return shipping."
7762,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Poor Quality Material as compared to older product. The quality of the material is inferior to the 80% cotton Russell sweatshirts I previously purchased.  I recently purchased two of these sweatshirts.  They are 50% cotton.  After wearing and washing them two times, the fabric is covered with ""pilling"" and they already look nasty.  It appears that Russell like so many other manufacturers is more interested in achieving higher profit at the expense of product quality.  I'll never purchase another Russell product."
7763,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Fit nice but cheaply made 2 of the 3 ripped within 1 week of receiving them. Poorly made
7764,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Nice but see-through. Fits as expected. I'm 5'9 and usually a size 4. I ordered a small. Only 3 stars because the fabric is thin and see-through. It will be OK for summer over a swimsuit.
7765,1,B09M6X79V9,0,They are short! Definitely NOT compressed
7766,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Meh... I was underwhelmed by this cardigan.  The one I got was irregular,  had hanging threads, and is super-light weight.  It is more like a cotton shirt, rather anything you'd use for warmth.  As other reviewers have said, it also is a lot shorter than the advertisement picture suggests. Also, the colors are much darker than the picture suggests.  They are a bit muddier and not as vibrant. Its too much trouble to send back, and I've worn it to work once or twice-- but it'll probably be something that I just use to cover with around the house."
7767,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"I bought the smallest size possible and they fit like drapes. I'm 5'7 Compression????  I bought the smallest size possible and they fit like drapes.  I'm 5'7, 115, 32D and I was sorely disappointed.  4/25 update - my UPS records show return was received Feb 1, 2017 & they recharged my card yesterday saying they hadn't received it!  Guess I'll have to contact Amazon üôÑ"
7768,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Ripped first day Loved the leggings but then I went to work out did some squats and I heard a tear. There‚Äôs a rip in the butt already so that‚Äôs really disappointing.  One time use I guess.
7769,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Great dress -don't machine wash I LOVED THIS DRESS. Until I washed it. Followed the instructions. Very gentle wash and hung dried. The seam right on the side just frayed and split. Not wearable anymore. Wore it one time. So if you get this dress don't wash it... or hand wash it.
7770,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Cute dress The picture of the dress was not what I got . I expected the dress to be long but what I got was long in the back and short in the front.  I need a summer dress for this week coming up so I kept it because it was still cute and it fits good . I have a small chest it fit just right and I have big hips but it fit just right .
7771,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Made small order bigger size Size chart is wrong! Get at least one size larger than what you usually wear. Fabric is thin, gave this set to a friend who is smaller. They look nice will wait til I wash them......"
7772,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Wrong size :( Kind of bummed because I was sent the wrong size. I ordered a M and got a L. The L is baggy in the crotch area. I was so excited about them too :/<br />Seem like good quality though
7773,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Ehh Easily tear when taking these off. Don‚Äôt dry very easily. They are comfortable and long enough to tuck.
7774,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Cheap and thin Would not buy again! Not worth the price at all, wish I could return it. Color is off too, not a true red"
7775,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Cheap and odd fit Cheap
7776,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Don‚Äôt buy! Horrible pilling problem from the get go. Unacceptable quality.
7777,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Don‚Äôt waste your money Shrunk terrible.<br />They became all lumpy after washing and this make them uncomfortable.<br />Worst feeling sweatpants I have ever owned.
7778,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Great look/fit but quality meh When I put these on for the first time the crotch ripped. Otherwise the fit and look was amazing. When I told the seller what had happened they said they would send me a new pair, which would have been great, however that was a couple of months ago and I never received them :( So I‚Äôm still searching for that perfect pair."
7779,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,I used to buy Russell Athletic sweat shirts all the ... I used to buy Russell Athletic sweat shirts all the time but the collars are a lot bigger now. I don't care for the big loose collars. Maybe It will be ok for people with big heads or big necks. I guess I have to find another sweat shirt brand.
7780,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Not for me I‚Äôm petite and although I got the smallest size it still looks too oversized. Going to return it.
7781,2,B09M6X79V9,0,I need thicker spandex Very comfortable but if you have a bit of a pooch you'll soon find you are wearing two bras.  The whole belly portion will ride up and assume a bra band position.  Maybe I was not the shape for this top?
7782,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star Tank tops are fine but they do NOT compress at all.
7783,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Runs too small
7784,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Didn‚Äôt fit like last order was tighter and ordered the Danes size Was smaller ordered same sizes but was tighter
7785,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Unflattering in the crotch area I am 5'8"" and 120 lbs. My height is primarily from my legs. Medium fell just above the ankles. The ankles were pretty tight and had almost no stretch to them. The material seemed a little too slippery/thin for my liking. It seemed squat proof to my flat bum but the tag on the bag claims it's only 65%-75% squat proof. The crotch area showed every curve and detail which made me return the item. However, they did make my butt appear a little bigger and flattering. Not a bad product for the right body but it wasn't my cup of tea sadly."
7786,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Disappointed I wish I would of kept everything to send it back. It doesn‚Äôt fit or look like the pic. Very disappointed with this item
7787,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Muddy colors I got the pink, purple and green set, and have to say that the colors are much darker and ‚Äúmuddier‚Äù in person, nothing like the photo."
7788,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Good shirts Shirts are great. Material was awesome for wearing during a mud-obstacle 5k. Only problem I have is that I ordered mediums (US) and they came as US: small, Europe: Medium."
7789,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"the white fit well and the material was nicely slick, the blue one felt stretched out after ... The sizes differ depending on the colors. I got a 3 pack: the white fit well and the material was nicely slick, the blue one felt stretched out after one wearing, and the gray one fit in the chest but the torso was about 3 inches too short, so I could barely tuck it in.  Not happy with the value and inconsistent sizing."
7790,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Material seems flimsy and fit baggy in chest area Baggy fit
7791,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Appeared to be big at first but fit perfectly
7792,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Decent quality but very large arms. The arms are extremely baggy for a medium.  If you like that than this is  great for you, if you prefer a normal to slim fit then avoid."
7793,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"They‚Äôre alright The leggings are pretty good material.. they fit well(ish).. I‚Äôm in the waist but my legs and butt area seem to be almost see through when I squat in these. I‚Äôm constantly pulling the fabric up to stay.. if you‚Äôre not sweating then the material slides down. I purchased another pair similar to this brand and I like their material 10x better as it‚Äôs thinner fabric, stays put, AND squat proof. I would probably just wear these out and about, or to the gym when it‚Äôs not leg day."
7794,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Almost two sizes too small. Fit is very small
7795,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Wrong size Size chart was wrong had to order a second order to get the right size.
7796,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star
7797,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Falling apart I like it.  It's good looking and very comfortable.  But the sleeve is fraying less than one week after I received it.  Can't recommend it.
7798,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Almost great Two of the shirts fit great but one seems smaller than the others.
7799,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheap and see through Very thin - see through. Ripped after 1st cold wash. Rolls up. No way I would wear out alone or at gym. Sleep wear only. Colors were nice and vibrant.
7800,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,MISLEADING These are dry fit tank tops - NOTHING compression about these.. how can they be? thin as a piece of paper!!
7801,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Not a 5x fit. Shrunk even more when washed ... Not a 5x fit.Shrunk even more when washed per instructions.
7802,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Scratchy So scratchy and it shrunk length wise.
7803,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"So disappointing üòû Doesn't fit well at all....boxy and not flattering on a curvy woman! Material quality, color and design are perfect! Wish the cut of of it was better."
7804,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Items that look the same color aren't. I bought what I thought was a matching set- leggings, sports bra, and crop top. When I finally received my items the leggings were a different color than the sports bra and top. I contacted the seller and all they said was that it was due to a different thickness. However, they weren't different shades but completely different colors. Seller didn't offer any help whatsoever. Am returning all items."
7805,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star Weirdly cut---like wearing a large potato sack
7806,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Inconsistent sizing I ordered a few of these shirt a while ago and I really enjoyed them. I decided to purchase three more and ordered a ""Large"" to match the ones I use. When I received the shirts, they were a USA Medium and an international Large. I figured I made a mistake in reading the label and then ordered 3 more as X-Large.<br /><br />When I received those they were USA X-Large and International 2XL. I really don't understand why I am getting the wrong sizes after spending $50 on two orders. I just needed a USA Large. Now I have 3 a size too big and 3 a size too small. Be careful when ordering the correct sizes."
7807,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Totally see-through I liked the fit and feel. I was about to wear them for the day and noticed I could see my leg skin. I called my daughter in and she said she could totally see my underwear and bottom. Nope.
7808,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not Neon Pink Not color shown. Had to return. Not happy
7809,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Two Stars I have a 46&#34; chest, and I'm swimming in the XL. It's way too big."
7810,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Fit was great but... Fit and color of these pants are great, but I found a hole on the hip area after washing. It wasn‚Äôt even in the seem. It was simply the material coming unraveled. Not cool! I have another pair because I bought these in two colors. The other pair don‚Äôt have a hole- at least not yet!"
7811,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Hiho Runs too small at chest
7812,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not bad for the price Bought these for my husband and they are really nice tank tops but they‚Äôre see through which is the only downfall. They also are somewhat a shorter length
7813,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Cheap Material Super cute dress and style. Ripped down the seam. For the amount of money, it's not worth the material. Loved the pockets though!"
7814,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"Sizing is inconsistent I bought this dress and the Cat print dress both in the largest size available (12-13 years old) as my daughter is tall for her age (9) and usually wears a 14-16. The cat print one barely covers her behind and the waist in it fits more like an empire dress! The lollipop dress (same size, brand, etc mind you), fits perfectly! I am really frustrated at the difference in fit! However, my daughter loves them both, so she will wear the cat print dress as a top with leggings."
7815,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not for compression They don't hold anything in, just like a regular tank top."
7816,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Poorly constructed. I had to sew 3/4 of one of the sleeves - the seam wasn't fully sewn. The material looks cheap and is very thin. It'll work for lounging around the house, but looks too much like pajamas for me to wear it out."
7817,1,B09M6X79V9,0,NOT COPRESSION JUST REGULAR TANK TOP I was very disappointed with this purchase. This is not a compression anything and the seam on the aidye is oddly place (diagonally). Extremely thin and cheap feeling. It fits true to size but not form fitting if that makes sense.
7818,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Each shirt in the pack fits differently So I bought a size bigger as suggested. All 3 fit differently so you can tell that it was rushed being made possibly? one shirt fits as it should, one fits just a little tighter and smaller and one is definitely a smaller fit from the other 2, I will order again but order 2 sizes up as I would reccomend for anyone else"
7819,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Stains all over it I received the sweatshirt with discoloration all over it. It looks like it‚Äôs been washed with bleach or something. Other than that it‚Äôs soft but super disappointed in what I got
7820,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Inaccurate sizing guide I followed the sizing chart listed by the company. The tanks were too large.
7821,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,just ok very bery basic- size does run large - but I could pick up the same thing at Walmart
7822,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Good shirts Good quality ample fit color not exactly as shown ,darker"
7823,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"They'll compress nothing!! While they are decent tank tops they are definitely not compression tank tops... They &#34;compress&#34; about as much as a cotton wife beater... I ordered  extra small based on another reviewer saying to go down a size... Even if I went down 3 sizes (which couldn't be done xs is the smallest option) they still wouldn't work as a compression top... They are pretty thin... They aren't a total loss though... The material didn't feel too bad. I chose the black, white, and grey option so I do have a variety to match with other clothing. The fit isn't horrible when you first put them on... However they don't fit the same after hours of wearing them... I couldn't imagine using them at the gym... If you sweat they're really gonna stretch out... And if you are looking to contain any kind of jiggle... Forget it... I gave two stars because they aren't the worst thing I've ever purchased... I like the T shaped back... It makes your back/shoulders look pretty badass... But the price wasn't that great for regular tank tops... For compression tank tops it would've been a phenomenal price... But as I've already said they're definitely not compression tank tops..."
7824,1,B09M6X79V9,0,These are very thin and doesn't seem to be actually ... These are very thin and doesn't seem to be actually compress anything.  üòï Perhaps I should have gone a size smaller to have the support I was looking for.
7825,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not much compression going on. Stylish workout shirt, but not tight. I'm a big guy. I'm 5'10"" and 300 lbs. The XXL is comfortably tight. No compression. I'll wear it as an undershirt, but kind of disappointed."
7826,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Not for me The material was thinner than what I thought it looked like on the picture.<br />Probably great for warmer weather because of how thin the dress was.
7827,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Everything great
7828,2,B09M6X79V9,0,It does not hold anything in Niether
7829,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"You can see right through them Normally I do not write reviews but in this case I felt it necessary. Before I bought these I read so many reviews and most of them were awesome. This product does not fit its description, they are very see through...i got these for work and there is no way to wear them unless I wear a shirt under it. Size was as expected."
7830,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Do not purchase There's no compression!! These tanks are a joke!
7831,1,B09M6X79V9,0,See through large weird sides Weird material super slick and not cloth. I just wanted some cotton/polyester stretch type material tank tops. But this is like see through weird slick material.
7832,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not Lifting I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 143 pounds, wear a medium so ordered a medium, the belly is covered, however, it rolls, and does not stay firm and tight. And clearly not butt lifting. I have a bit of a booty, and these made me look a bit flat in the booty area. Not satisfied nor happy with these at all."
7833,2,B0928FSGGD,0,tight I am 135 pounds I bought extra large super tight
7834,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I think it's a cute dress though I like the pockets on the It was a little to big for a medium, it's supposed to fit loose but it's too loose. I think it's a cute dress though I like the pockets on the side"
7835,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Tight Cheap. Small.
7836,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,I It was smaller and shorter than expected
7837,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Soft but not a compression tank Super soft.. good for wear under other clothing.. NOT COMPRESSION
7838,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"more like a size smaller I bought three other Jerzee's hooded sweatshirts sized XL and they fit perfectly.  For some reason this one fit much tighter, more like a size smaller.  Disappointed, really liked the color."
7839,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Tiny! I am a large in all pants but these are miniature! Length was a little short but I could barely fit a leg in them. Are these for kids?? There is about 4 inches of fabric to cover the butt.
7840,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,I loved them but sending them back because they were huge. Going to order a small size Way to big
7841,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"slids up, does not stay on waist. does not stay on waist but slides up."
7842,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"One Star The material is cheap, and thin!"
7843,3,B009R09Z8W,0,I like the quality & look of this Tie Die but ... I like the quality & look of this Tie Die but it came too big & I will have to send it back & get a size that fits.
7844,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I like the style unlined, but has pockets and is well-fitting according to the sizes posted here. I like the style."
7845,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,WAY TO SHORT Low stars because the shirts are VERY short. These are the first compression shirts I have ever purchased that aren't able to be tucked in (which is the point) I wear compression shirts to the gym and having them roll up is a real pain in the ass. Unfortunately I won't be able to wear these. I'm 6'2&#34; tall and the the 2XL are cut for someone who's 5'6&#34; or so.
7846,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"I expected something better the fabric is a bit fragile and the shade of blue is different from the tone described in the ad, it‚Äôs lighter."
7847,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Muy fina la tela Lo usa mi hija debajo del skrob pero es muy fina la tela
7848,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Thin, light compression, not a strong shirt Fit as expected, I ordered a smaller size intentionally to get more 'compression' but it's a weak material. Light compression at best.<br />I'm a large male at 6'2"" and 285lbs. I ordered large and it fits but it's thin and less effective than the last set of shirts I ordered."
7849,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Not at all as pictured.  Barely goes past the knee. Looks and fits aweful.
7850,3,B09M6X79V9,0,You will sweat Definitely feels like i sweat way more when im wearing them. Very flattering and holds you in.
7851,2,B097RFTKJP,0,What you see is not what you get-too large for a large I loved the style but it said Large but it was way too big for me
7852,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not sweat proof Great material and very comfortable, however, they aren‚Äôt sweat proof as seen here in the photo."
7853,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not great for compression It is very thin material and it doesn't really compress at all. I got the size as recommended on the sizing chart based on my measurements.  (I actually got 1 size smaller) and it feels like a normal dry fit tank. I like compression shirts to prevent the nipple chafe from running and this did not work my first run in them.
7854,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Poor quality!!! Poor quality!!!<br /><br />The fabric is so thin you can see through it.<br />I wrote this one time euch lead to the fabric to through Fabric bunnies. This was a waste of time and money.
7855,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Incredibly Sheer I bought these vital 2.0 leggings and their counter part in the vital 2.0 shorts as a more affordable alternative to the gym shark vital 2.0  leggings and shorts. The fit and compression was great. They both fit comfortably and allowed for movement while staying tight around all the right places; however, when I squatted in them, you could see the entirety of my butt and underwear. They were so sheer that you could see the tone of my skin through the fabric. I was really excited when I found this brand and style on Amazon, but unfortunately, they weren‚Äôt what I was looking for."
7856,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Weird seam I‚Äôm shocked that anyone would actually want to keep this dress as the seam is oddly placed right down the center of it - in front. And the polkadots of course do not lineup because it‚Äôs so cheap. Sending back.
7857,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Definitely not what I was expecting I expected these to be sweatpants. They are made with the same materials as yoga pants and so you don‚Äôt have the soft cozy feel of sweatpants nor do you get the tight compression of leggings or yoga pants. It‚Äôs somewhere in between and not very flattering.
7858,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,shows everything The light colors show every line and crevice  so not the most flattering but very comfy
7859,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Safety pink doesn‚Äôt match picture I‚Äôm not returning it, but the color (safety pink) is not the same as the picture and it had like white specs mixed in the color. It‚Äôs more of a sweatshirt I‚Äôll wear around home, not a trendy fashion sweatshirt."
7860,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Love these but don‚Äôt last long I love these sooo much, flattering and comfy for the gym. Def remind me of the gymshark look. However I‚Äôve had these a little over a month now, worn only a few times and I have a hole already. I‚Äôm super sad about it. Old Navy leggings aren‚Äôt as flattering and compressive but are way cheaper and I have yet to get any holes."
7861,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,AWESOME MATERIAL MADE  WELL RUNS VERY SMALL
7862,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"The dress is really cute... but when ... The dress is really cute...but when I put it on, my boobs were smooshed...but the rest of the dress was comfy."
7863,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"One Star It said to order a size larger, so I ordered a 5x..  it's not 5x.. it's more small/med."
7864,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,weird would not buy again. its a tank top with a hood. not my cup of tea. dont know why i bought guess i thought it had sleeves and wasnt paying attention.. it fits ok. but i wore a shirt under it just for modesty sake.
7865,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Like a cheap hoodie Not what I expected feels and fits like a cheap hoodie not worth the 28 dollars I paid . Not buying any more Joe‚Äôs products over priced low quality goods
7866,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"It shrinks‚Ä¶ Loved it at first wore it once, I put it in the washer, hung to dry and it shrank. I want my money back. Not worth it. Don‚Äôt buy."
7867,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not a great fit and no compressi9n at all. Material too thin also To thin and no compression
7868,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,the shirt pills terribly--poor quality-- the  shirt pills terribly--poor quality--

7870,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Disappointed It's extremely sad , regardless to how impressive the  listed item may appear, reading the reviews provides vital information. Please read carefully before submitting & placing your order."
7871,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Dont waste your money Not at all what the picture looks like
7872,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Sizing is super strange Update: 2 years later I thought I'd try again with Medium. Tag says medium but there's a small ""xs""I tag sewn underneath and they definitely fit like an XS. Frustrating! See pic.<br /><br />I ordered small originally, I'm a size 4 with no bum or thighs. They were at least 2 sizes too big, very baggy, had to use the drawstring - unflattering. So naturally, I sized down to the XS, which are made for a size 00. Couldn't get them over my (non-existent) hips. I don't know who was in charge of measuring these, but they should be fired. LOL."
7873,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"very disappointed!! I had purchased the same exact dress very disappointed!!  I had purchased the same exact dress, same size but different color and it fit perfect.  This one is way too small across the bust. And to make matters worse there is no return address or paperwork included for me to exchange it"
7874,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Photos are not accurate. Pictures not accurate. The polka dots are much larger than pictured on the model so they have more of a ‚Äúmaternity dress/ clown print‚Äù vibe. The hem is also much higher in the front than pictures on the model.
7875,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not thrilled. Wasted money. They are super thin. Scratchy material.  I bought them to wear under my clothing for when on my motorcycle. The purpose was moisture wicking. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 160 # I‚Äôm a muscle build and these fit ok except they are so darn short, you can‚Äôt tuck them even into high wasted jeans and sit down without them untucking. They were PERFECT until I washed them as per directions on clothing label."
7876,1,B076QD9NP1,0,Not as expected! This dress looks like crisp cotton in the photo but is actually made of swimsuit fabric.
7877,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"They are high waisted but the roll down As someone who loves high waisted pants‚Äî especially for working out‚Äî these were disappointing. They were higher in the front than they were in the back and within a minute of virtually no movement, the front rolled down and then the back followed suite. Not ideal for working out."
7878,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Not for short and/or large chested women. I usually wear a small in workout tops but based on other reviews I sized down. The extra small was so loose and looked nothing like the photo. Because I‚Äôm petite but rocking a 36D, the top just didn‚Äôt look right at all. It was loose in all the wrong places and the material seemed pretty cheap. Returning!"
7879,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Super weird cut Super weird cut
7880,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Fitment I‚Äôm a medium in any normal shirt, the medium for these workout shirts are tighter then a normal medium and also shorter."
7881,2,B09M6X79V9,0,They don't compress at all These are supposed to compress but they don't do that at all. I was disappointed when I tried them on.
7882,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not at all as expected I ordered a large and it was super tight on the chest so I traded it for an xlarge and it's too big everywhere. Also the polka dots are FAR bigger then they seem in the description photos.
7883,3,B097RFTKJP,0,So so dress I like it but too see through and the material looks so cheap.
7884,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Good quality for great price For this low price, you really can‚Äôt beat this set. Good stretch and comfortable. I expected it to be a bit more compression than it was, but I‚Äôm still happy with my purchase."
7885,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Rough material and shrinks when washed. Material is rough and it shrinks when washed.
7886,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"no pockets description said these had pockets. if they didn't, I wouldn't have ordered them. I only found out after I had washed them & put them on that they did not have pockets. seriously disappointed."
7887,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Very soft, fits perfectly Love dress, lots of compliments BUT if you sit to long, it makes white marks as in a wrinkly look. I will order a second one."
7888,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Does NOT reflect like traditional Wife Beaters Product does not match as pic shown.
7889,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Not worth it Ran small, thin, and not very soft"
7890,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Shrinks when washed Shrinks to very short when washed and dried
7891,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Tee's not worth it
7892,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Smaller than expected This dress was very small theru the chest area
7893,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Weird fit Dislike. Weird fit
7894,2,B07XD71F1H,0,No a good material. Light weight and thin. I am sending both back as to sizes to small and to thin to wear for winter. Thought it would be great as a dress with leggings but made cheaply‚Ä¶
7895,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Thin material didn't like the almost see thru
7896,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,missing Nothing in mailbox!!!
7897,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression Nice workout shirts, but they are NOT compression"
7898,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Demasiado grande Ped√≠ taya S pero  es una S grande llega a M
7899,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Do not waste your money! I bought three pairs of these. Pink ones came with hole in pocket. Gray pair the eyelet around drawstring came off after one wear. The blue gray pair have a hole in the crotch after one wear. I am disgusted!
7900,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Don‚Äôt buy I was sent a lousy Gildan hoodie. This is a scam
7901,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Too small I bought the size I normally do. Way too small. Unable to return! Not happy!!!!
7902,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Only wore once :( Loved the dress however after first washed looked awful and had a wear mark on the back.. looked old and worn out. Disappointed because it was a cute dress<br />Tried reaching out but I‚Äôm assuming since it was past the return date no one bothered to respond.<br />(Bought the dress for a summer trip we planned that‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt get worn or washed until then )
7903,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Nice material It is very comfortable fabric, stretchy but too form fitting.  If you have a great body that's fine, but it shows every bulge and can be unflattering."
7904,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"good You can also.Sleeves a little long, but the impact is not too great. Clothes, work is good.thank you very much."
7905,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Put your $$$ into UA, Nike, or Adidas! NOT these. Too short and moves around a lot. I bought these in Aug of '16 and tried them out for the last 4 months. I would NOT buy these again! Only reason they got a start is because they are lightweight and breathable. Ya, you do get three for the price of one UA, Nike or Adidas, etc, but I WILL spend my money on one QUALITY item vs. three that I will donate ASAP. The sizing is a joke. I am 5'11&#34; 192, athletic build and they ride up, dont stay tucked, just NO GOOD! If you sit at a desk all day, may work for you, otherwise  put your $$$ into UA, Nike,or Adidas."
7906,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Three Stars Small wasn't skin tight for it to be compression wear. I am 5' 1&#34; 118 lbs, athletic built."
7907,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Inconsistent Quality The stitching is inconsistent. The grey and blue shirts fit pretty well, but the stitching under the arms on the black one flares out as if there is too much material.<br /><br />Update: Stictching on one of the shirts came undone after two washes."
7908,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Great hoodie, bad customer service. I bought this hoodie originally about 5 months ago. I bought the off-white ('sand') colored one. It was a fine lightweight cheap hoodie and exactly the style I was looking for. That hoodie got ruined by something I spilled on it so I ordered another.<br /><br />The new one arrived about a week ago and even though I selected the right color and the label on the bag it came in was the right color, it was totally off. It was this gross dark brown color.<br /><br />So I thought, okay fine was probably just a mix-up. I return it and order another. The second one comes and the exact same thing. So because Amazon's UI is terrible and I can't find a way to directly contact the seller I've just decided to go buy a different one from a more competent on-brand company.<br /><br />I really liked that first hoodie, but I can't stand a company making the same mistake twice."
7909,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Too large Very large and boxy. Returning item.
7910,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not Compression Shirts I don't have anything bad to say about these because plenty of the reviews said exactly what I found out when I ordered a couple packs.  These aren't compression shirts, they don't hold your stomach in at all and I ordered a Medium and am 6'5"" tall so two sizes smaller.  They're still great shirts for the price to wear under a tee to keep from sweating through or for the gym.  Just don't order them if your goal is to give a slimming effect because that's not something they do."
7911,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Poorly cut These are made from cheap ‚Äúsilky‚Äù material. The cut is small and awkward. I would not buy these again.
7912,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Over priced for the low quality. i would have returned them but i had orders to fill.  
7913,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Horrible Horrible dress cheap material very ugly I bought it based on good reviews but I returned I do not recommend
7914,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Seam is in front right down the middle and the ... Seam is in front right down the middle and the polka dots don‚Äôt match up. Makes the dress look really cheap.
7915,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression at all It says compression, they definitely are not. Decent quality. But not compression. Good for the price for a workout shirt. Wicks sweat."
7916,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Mucha inversi√≥n para la calidad de la tela!!! La tela es muy ligera y arrugona, no me hizo clip. Cae muy burdo"
7917,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Comfy and silly looking.... I hated that amazon put the seam in the middle front... the dress would be a keeper if wasn‚Äôt for that... donating it...
7918,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Chest area a bit smaller than expected
7919,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Just a lycra layer NOT COMPRESSION
7920,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,soft you get what you pay for. fit fine but found some more expensive but well worth the money
7921,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Fit problems Disappointed. This dress fit me everywhere but at the top. Donating it in hopes someone else will have better luck.
7922,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Spend your money on something else Not worth it
7923,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Fairly Low Quality This product was definitely not as sturdy as is should have been. The first time I put it on and reached into the pocket, the seam ripped a couple inches. The price was reasonable, but it's always a disappointment when something fails that quickly."
7924,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Save your money Photo leads you to believe at the very least the sleeves are a warm woven fabric when in reality the whole thing is cheap polyester, not warm, thin."
7925,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"but this large was good in the long and extra large by the shoulders ... My husband is always large, but this large was good in the long and extra large by the shoulders and sleeves, need to look for slim cut now.  This is going to be returned, the fabric feel nice though"
7926,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Too tight! Way too small and uncomfortable arm seams.
7927,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Beautiful dress, takes forever to receive It takes forever to recieve."
7928,2,B076QD9NP1,0,Ok Feels like swim suit material. Smaller than expected. Was told it would be here Saturday before Easter and did not arrive til late sunday.
7929,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"too big I ordered these in a small size, but received extra large"
7930,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Joggers Not going to wear them they so fake look like a kids put the patches on
7931,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Pattern not as pictured Not as pictured, the dress round white dots rather than the pattern shown"
7932,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Beware of fit changes! I bought a pair of blue ones from here that I loved! They hit over my belly button and at my ankle- which is hard to do since I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1. Unfortunately when I ordered the gray pair they fit differently. They went barely at my hips and above my ankle line.  I‚Äôm not sure why the same style and size would make a difference?
7933,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"Armholes are HUGE Would not recommend unless child will wear undershirt or camisole underneath. Armholes way too large and revealing. Furthermore, I returned this product due to poor fit over a week ago and have still not gotten my refund. What‚Äôs up with that?"
7934,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Rit The zipper worked hard and the sleeves were exceptionally long.
7935,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not what I ordered months ago I love these when I ordered them the first time. Receive them they‚Äôre horribly made polyester stitching is horrible. Never order from them again
7936,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Not as good as I had hoped.
7937,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not as expected These can hardly be considered compression tops.
7938,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression tops but decent. They're not compression tops at all but they're good for beating the heat in summer.
7939,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Not as pictured Not as long as pictured.  Very thin. Disappointed.
7940,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Three Stars Not cut true to size.
7941,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Normally wear a medium and went one size larger so ... Normally wear a medium and went one size larger so it would be longer. The fit is OK but it still wasn‚Äôt long enough. If you‚Äôre doing a lot of overhead reach as part of your workout and have a long torso, it still probably won‚Äôt cover you."
7942,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very uncomfortable material The material is so uncomfortable, especially for working out. Very disappointed."
7943,3,B09M6X79V9,0,not really a compression tank I wear them to work every day. It is not really compression tank. Material is a little thin.
7944,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Disappointed Looks much nicer in the picture . Poor quality , shorter than expected and much smaller than expected."
7945,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,pretty but i received a different color then i ordered I was looking for some light pink cute leggings for the gym but these are neon pink and so pretty but not what i ordered.
7946,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Three Stars just ok, too large to wear out in public"
7947,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Good material. Runs small. Order a size up.. Shirts are nice. Good material, but they run small. I just gave them to my daughter."
7948,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"This is a very good sweat shirt This is a very good sweat shirt.  Although claiming to be the same size as the older versions I  have bought, the new one is slightly smaller.  I have<br />not gained any wight.  It still fits,  It may stretch a bit -- I hope so.  It is warm and comfortable."
7949,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"too high waisted these are really flattering but the waist goes up sooo high and the waistband gets a little tight as the day goes on (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 130 and got my normal size small)"
7950,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Bottom of top rolls up Love the compression it helps me since I had breast masectomy surgery.  What I dislike is the bottom of the top rolls up .
7951,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star Tank tops don‚Äôt even look like the pictures
7952,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Shirts are not compression. They do fit skin tight ... Shirts are not compression. They do fit skin tight but no compression. I'm comparing to Tommie Copper compression shirts.
7953,2,B009R09Z8W,0,... a Large size and the quality was not the best. The item was small for a Large size and the quality was not the best.
7954,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Horrible it's super short in the back Horrible it's super short in the back, does not look anything like the picture . I don't want to give it any star but requires you to rate it"
7955,2,B09M6X79V9,0,2 sizes smaller than expected I ordered my normal size shirts (2X). They fit as a large. The shirts are tight and not flattering. On the positive side they can be undershirts.
7956,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,cheap very poor quality material; the sleeves are too wide and too short. material is very thin and is made out of low quality material.do not buy it! waste of money
7957,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Disappointed Very thin material. No support. Not at all what I expected for a compression workout tank.
7958,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Pretty good Nice low neckline that I was looking for.
7959,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Good It‚Äôs alright
7960,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Compression tanks Cheap material and doesn‚Äôt hold!  Definitely not compression! Very disappointed!
7961,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Ok but the color doesn't match It is comfortable but I ordered neon pink and semi-bright pink is what arrived.
7962,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Too small. Did not follow the size description Too small
7963,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Doesn't look like the picture! This is comfy but not as pictured. The dots are HUGE,  which looks cheap and Minnie Mouse-ish. It is shorter than pictured also."
7964,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Three Stars Runs small
7965,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,More like a rashgaurd Not as thick as I would like‚Äî fits/ looks more like a rashgaurd for swimming. No thumbs holes if that‚Äôs important to you.
7966,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Fabric is very mesh-like in person I ordered these for my son for Christmas. He chose them. They arrived quickly. However when he opened them the fabric is very much more mesh than expected and picture (very ‚Äúholey‚Äù). This is not his style so we returned it, easily as always with Amazon."
7967,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Not anything like I ordered I wear a size small. This dress was a size 6x and green. I hate green. Not anything like I ordered
7968,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Very nice but large I have always loves these simple crew neck sweaters. Instant classic. One word of warning - I'm 6' 180 lbs with a 40 tall jacket and I'm absolutely swimming the large size I bought.<br /><br />Will buy again but ill go for a medium next time.
7969,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Nope!! Were not as long as described and poor quality! If I could I would get a refund. Wash as instructed and shrunk even more. üòü
7970,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Runs large Ordered large and it does not compress the loose skin of man boos from weight loss, probably should have ordered M."
7971,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"NOT COMPRESSION I originally bought these for after pregnancy to help getting my shape back. These tank tops are NOT high compression tanks at all. They feel similar to wearing a Nike Dry Fit tank. Though they stretch some and are super comfy, they aren‚Äôt really true compression tank tops."
7972,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not a true size Can‚Äôt give it a review product was sent back cause not a true size.
7973,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Don‚Äôt buy! Looked like a sack!
7974,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"not compression and not long These are absolutely NOT compression tanks and I would not describe them as 'long'. I will wear them under shirts, but I do not think they are the best type of tank for working out. I don't understand the other reviews that describe them as smaller than expected. I ordered up a size based on other reviews and they are loose fitting. I would recommend ordering true to your size and not adjusting your order based on the reviews like I did."
7975,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not what I expected Not really a compression tank
7976,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars very long
7977,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,It's mesh like a practice jersey. Not a clue what they were trying to do with this blouse for men to workout in. But to each their own I suppose
7978,3,B07XD71F1H,0,This winter fabric was tighter than expected. Wanted to have a short dress for Fall weather.
7979,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Didn‚Äôt like fit Liked the fabric and seem well made but didn‚Äôt like the slim fit. I‚Äôm an older (70) women and don‚Äôt like to see underwear seams. Don‚Äôt think a larger size would have made a difference.
7980,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Dose not work for me Dose not work for me did help with back pain though
7981,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Disappointed Completely see thru.
7982,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cute yet non-compression Cute and it matches everything. However, the compression is non-existent. I want to feel like a can of biscuits when I wear compression tops."
7983,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,Good for the money paid Great style and great fit just wrong material.
7984,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Im not sure about these! These are decent tank tops. I purchased the size based on the size chart from the seller and they are still to big.  If I was to buy them I would by a size smaller then what they said to purchase.
7985,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"All were different size, weird. This was pack of 3, grey was good.<br />Black was xs size I guess and red was small.<br />And Red color is really bad shade, disappointed."
7986,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Nice dress Had to take away two stars because Seam became undone on first wash.
7987,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Runs small, very thin, not compression The sizing chart was not typical, so based off the reviews saying it runs small I went up a size, well they arrived and 1 size up was ok, but not perfect. The material is way too thin to be compression. I wanted them for under T'shirts, which would have been perfect because they are thin, but the seam doesn't run straight down, it curves to the front. For my overall liking these just didn't hit the mark."
7988,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Unflattering Oh My God. This was so unflattering I couldn't even take pictures to post with this review for fear that they would be used for blackmail. The fabric was really nice and the color was as expected.
7989,1,B0B16Q1854,0,I think the pants are small in size. Need a larger size.
7990,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,It does not look like the photo at all!! Very average t shirt material.  Color is faded too. Not worth the money.. it is not as long it seems in photo!! Returning it!!
7991,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"too big, pattern off Print wasnt like picture and neither was cut of the dress."
7992,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Too wide i was little disapionted
7993,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,One Star Does not do a thing for your waits
7994,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Disappointed The pants are beautiful and comfortable. I loved the huge lettering on the side and the huge us polo design, but when received they seemed used. They are very frayed in the crotch area."
7995,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"not much compression I'm 5'8"" 205#.  I ordered Large and they're not very tight. I would say they run pretty true to size. Don't order larger than you'd normally wear or it won't compress you.  I'd try a Medium next time."
7996,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Good tops but not for me Only putting 3 stars because I just didn't like how they looked on me... Might be good for someone else but didn't look right on me at all
7997,2,B0B16Q1854,0,It‚Äôs ok. Once you wash these a few times the color fades a lot and they look really old. I bought a similar pair at the same time and have washed those just as much as these and they still look brand new unlike these
7998,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,fabric did not like fabric outershell
7999,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Got what you pay for Love this hoodie, fits true to size, perfect color. Only downside is that the fabric has gotten super peely"
8000,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Three Stars Material too thin, and color not as white!"
8001,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheap Cheap and not accurate sizing
8002,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"Cheap fabric, pilled first wash Very rough fabric, pilled after the first wash. Ran small and shrank even washing in cold and hanging dry. We bought a decent hoodie from H&M to replace this one."
8003,3,B0B16Q1854,0,A lighter sweatpants I wish they were a little softer and heavier
8004,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not Compression Shirts I have a 40 inch chest and got medium. They are not substitutes for Under Armor. There is no compression.
8005,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars returned
8006,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Don't waste your money I definitely wouldn't describe these as ""compression""  or long. I won't be ordering more because they ride up when I sit down or bend over. I will be using them as a barrier layer under my waist trainer. I wore one for an entire day so now I can't return them but I really wish I could."
8007,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not a compression shirt I originally purchased the XL according to the chest size chart but after trying it on it was too big and very loose for a compression shirt.  I ended up returning them and went down to a large size instead which fits well, however,  the material is very thin and just feels like a regular moisture wicking shirt with no compression. I do not feel like returning it again so I will keep these to use as regular workout shirts.  Bottom line is do not buy these shirts if you are looking for compression unless you purchase 2 or 3 sizes smaller than your normal size. The material is great quality but the description is a little misleading."
8008,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,One Star Lint attracting..
8009,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Super cute dress, just to clingy I absolutely wanted to love this dress. After reading the reviews, I intentionally ordered a size up in hopes that it wouldn't cling to me. Unfortunately, it showed every flaw, even though it was loose fitting, due to the type of material. I was so disappointed that I had to return it."
8010,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,its not the same color as the picture The sweatshirt is more of a light pink and not that color in the picture
8011,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Mediocre, but nice style. These tank tops are perfect to wear under a dressy shirt and they're also good for working out or casual wear. However, the material tends to crawl up and curl up if you're wearing your exact size. I ordered smalls since I'm built small, and in the middle of the evening, it rode up my stomach. They are super comfy and perfect fit, but depending on how you sit or what you wear over them, they have a tendency to shift around."
8012,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Thin and cheap Listing said this was ‚Äúheavyweight‚Äù...farthest thing from the truth!
8013,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"They lied Not compression at all, pretty loose."
8014,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"One star Way too large, and after one use the front pocket has begun to tear at the corner"
8015,3,B09M6X79V9,0,I need 4x My shirts I order they r to small and they say 3x but I should of got 4x but it will just keep them I didn't like these tank tops so I didn't know they were so spandex tight on me so I am not wearing them
8016,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Material is see-through, returned The pictures don't show this, but the material is see-through. Returned immediately."
8017,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Dirty Nice jacket for price but came with dirt on it!
8018,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Doesn't fit good. Made for thin people.
8019,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"The hoods on these hoodies are overly large and very ... The hoods on these hoodies are overly large and very heavy, so I have to keep pulling the front of the hoodie down to keep from feeling choked."
8020,1,B07XD71F1H,0,the material was awful a thought the 2 dresses would be nice. . but will never buy again.
8021,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Nice for the price I bought the white they‚Äôre see through so not good for working out in!!!! However I got the black and did keep those
8022,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Pockets small, stitching is off, larger than expected Too large. Have to tie the waistband tight to keep the size I normally wear up. The stitching feels off. The pockets are small. The ankles are so tight I almost fell getting them on. Overall, not a great buy. Get something else!"
8023,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Cheap material gets the lil fuzz balls and faded after one wash Waste of money after a wash it faded and got lil fuzz balls.
8024,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Run a bit small Nice lightweight material. They run a bit on the smaller side. I am a female and I normally wear a medium in women‚Äôs and small in men‚Äôs clothing. I purchased these a size larger hoping for looser fit and they fit like a typical men‚Äôs small.
8025,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Tank Top Pack Nice potential, but extremely tight-fitting. I would only recommend buying these if you like really tight clothing."
8026,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Three Stars Liked the colors
8027,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ok but not compression These are ok. 3 stars because I bought them for compression. I bought medium I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 165lbs. Would get Large normally for a comfortable fit. These fit but not compression at all. Comfortable close fit even by getting a medium. Material is thin and stretchy but they look well made. The blue is longer than the black and grey. Not worn to workout yet so will update when I do.
8028,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Size up for sure! These are nice but definitely size way up!!
8029,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"No Support.  No compression. I bought these tank tops, because I like to wear something to support my breasts a bit when I sleep.  I thought these would be perfect, but when I put one on, I was disappointed to see that I had no more support than I would have if I were wearing any other tank top that was too big for me.  I do wear a G cup, so this could, in all like;ihood, fit  and work nicely for someone with different measurements."
8030,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Shirts run extremely small Would never wear them ,they run extremely small in size and recommend size is very wrong."
8031,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Wanted to love it Ordered XL based on other reviews. Too tight in chest. Wear 44DDD
8032,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Where's the rest of the shirt ... By breathable.... I'll just say.... there's not a lot of material. Can work as a layered workout top.
8033,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,One Star Nothing like the picture. Not at all true to size. Very disappointed.
8034,3,B09M6X79V9,0,If you‚Äôre size M order XL It‚Äôs kind of reduced for a M size
8035,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,More like a silky tang top These are not compression shirts. More like a silky tang top.

8037,1,B097RFTKJP,0,too small Not for the full waist woman
8038,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Returned.
8039,1,B076QD9NP1,0,Fabric ripped after washing once Fabric ripped after washing once :(
8040,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Clothes To small
8041,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,The seams tore! The stitches came right off! Tried contacting seller but got no response I bought these leggings 5 months ago and absolutely loved them! Perfect fit etc! However the stitching on the seams  tore and the seller has not responded. Perfect leggings except for this!
8042,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small Ordered xl was sent xxl. Product runs small
8043,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,is big I spect fit but is big
8044,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not that good. Fitted waist band but everything else was less then desirable.
8045,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"CUTE DESIGNED REGULAR TOP NOTHING SPECIAL The recomended size for this product is inaccurate. I wore one of the tops today and i had issues keeping the shirt pulled down and from riding 1/2 the way up my torso wile walking as well as it's supposed to be a compression top but my personal opinion is that it's quite the opposite of a compression, shaping top. I would recommend buying 1-2 sizes larger than recommend true fit size and understand that the product IS NOT ACCURATELY ADVERTISED. It's really just a really cute designed regular tang-top and nothing more. I was honestly disappointed when i unwrapped the package and even more disappointed when i tried to wear the top out for the walk."
8046,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Size not realistic Received the items and they seemed to be of good quality but I ordered a medium and they looked like extra small. I know they are for compression fit but I would say you'd need to order them at least one size bigger than needed.
8047,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Not perfect but functional These shirts I bought to put under my uniform for work. They worked out perfectly for that, but I would recommend buying one size up. I did just that and they fit me to a T.  I also had a problem with one of my shirts seams coming undone in the laundry just after the first washing! The other two have held up perfectly fine so far."
8048,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"way too small and flimsy material I buy a lot of clothing online and use the reviews to help determine sizing.  I am a size 6 and ordered the medium which was way too small,  Material is somewhat flimsy.  Not impressed."
8049,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Way too big, soft though. Way Way too big. Followed the directions for sizing and they are definitely NOT compression tanks. Sending back today."
8050,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very disappointed At 1st glance, I love these tops. Cute, comfortable, nice fit. However, I decided to wash them before I wore them and that pink lining started to separate also there is a lot of string is coming from the bottom line."
8051,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Too small I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, weigh 138lbs and ordered a medium. These leggings are extremely tight and not faltering at all. They hug in all the wrong places. I‚Äôll never order another pair again."
8052,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Too short Very short - not for those with long upper bodies
8053,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Horrible quality and customer service! I ordered 4 pairs of leggings from them and three of them ripped at the inner crotch area within one day of using and a couple had the seams at the bottom of the leg completely messed up. I reached out to them but haven‚Äôt heard back.
8054,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"If you're above 5'6"" this will be too short If you're above 5'6"" this will be too short"
8055,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Was a bit too short I have bought some before 3 times all medium all perfect but when I bought a large it was like different material and the length was shorter than my other order I want to get more but how can I be sure to actually get what I pay for
8056,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Decent tank tops, poor stitching. Decent tank tops. Poor quality stitching though. A few seems have already torn but I would buy again for the price."
8057,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Color not as shown Color not as in photo.  Photo looks to be an ashy blue.  Shirt is very gray with a lavender undertone in the sunlight.  No tags, except inside tags, whatsoever on shirt"
8058,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Very thin material no sure how long it could last Material is very thin
8059,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Rides up when running Fit well. Poor manufacturing, weird seems that are too long. The shirts ride up when running so I would not recommend for high impact/intensity workout"
8060,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Cut a little big for my taste and lighter in weight than I expected.
8061,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,I didn't like how short it was in the back and long ... I didn't like how short it was in the back and long in the front I ended up giving it to a different person
8062,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Much shorter than I expected or would like.
8063,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Cute fit This dress was very comfortable and flattering. I have 3 stars only because it‚Äôs a tad see through (like in the chest of the light hits it right) and I haven‚Äôt had it long enough/put it through the wash enough to know it‚Äôs quality.
8064,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Tight around the neck Beautiful color but really tight around the neck
8065,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Don't buy it It's not as shown on picture, the quality is bad, the black and the gray looks so similar and I recieved my package open."
8066,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Nice La tela es buena, sin embargo me quedo muy ajustado o peque√±o. Si lo compras debes comprarlo una talla m√°s grande a menos que desee que le quede bien ajustado."
8067,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Quality control? I was a bit disappointed; was wearing around house first time  and realized there was a 1 1/2 inch hole in the wrist seam. Since I had already removed all labels I mended myself. Now my husband is wondering if seconds are being sold???
8068,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Meant for a large butt. Nice color, well made, very nice material & a lot of room in the rear. üò≥<br />Didn‚Äôt flatter me because I have a tiny butt."
8069,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,An okay work out shirt See through and a bit long but other than that I like it.
8070,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Way too large I have bought this before in department stores and always wore a size &#34;Large&#34;.<br />However, these are huge.  Going back.  The upper arm sleve is enormous.<br />The shirt is nice and appears to be good quality, however, now I am out the shipping and return shipping costs."
8071,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Ok Very thin material.
8072,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Okay Not at all what I expected but I wear then anyways. I ordered all same size of course but yet it feels like the black and blue ones fit smaller than the pink one. Weird.
8073,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Doesn‚Äôt look like the picture The dots are actually huge and don‚Äôt look at all like the dress in the picture.
8074,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not worth your money This product is terrible. I wore it not even a day and the seams were already coming apart and later in the day began to form a big hole inside the leg area. Not worth it.
8075,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Very Cheap Quality The material is very ‚Äújersey-like‚Äù, very thin and just poor quality. The tag makes it look very cheap and like it‚Äôs not from a brand, but more from like a random person, or mass production of cheap tanks."
8076,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Small Runs very small. I realize they were meant to be snug but there's a difference between small and snug
8077,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"I wanted to like these more.... Honestly, they're not terrible shirts for the money. My biggest issue was they don't really compress that much... which is the point of the shirt. 2.5/5."
8078,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Not heavy Thin hoodies not worth the $29.00
8079,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Too deep arm holes I did like the color and super light, but the cut for the arms is way too deep. Will clearly see all of your sports bra if wear this tank. A little more revealing than I'd like. Otherwise, decent tank overall and good for hot hot summers."
8080,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"They're good Little smaller than I would like, but they're okay."
8081,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not bad for the price White is completely see through. Runs a little small so I would size up. Definitely moisture wicking. I sweat a TON in the gym and it barley showed on these shirts
8082,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"3.5 outta 5 seems fair. Started out buying a 2XL. My gf is 5'5 and curvy and I read some reviews saying buy larger size if you're curvy. So my gf is normally an XL so I bought 2XL. They were humongous. Too big too long. The 2XL was so big that we went down to L. The L was way too small. So my thinking is now go XL..which is her true size. The XL and the L are the exact same size. We even laid them on top of each other and the sweatpants were exactly same size. So I go to the sizes for the 4th attempt and I finally notice..there is XL and then there is 1XL. So I purchased the 1XL and it was the right size for her hips, butt, thighs etc..but they look like they are about 3 inches too long. The challenge is finding the correct length for the sizes above a L. My gf doesn't care because they're just lazy pants and the extra length helps keep feet warm. But it was a nightmare trying to size these sweatpants. Other than finding your true size in these..everything else is great! My gf would probably give these a 4 star, but she wasn't dealing with the purchasing and returning and return labels etc..I gotta take half a star away for that part as well."
8083,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Poor quality Well....I'm pretty sure I didn't order a pair with a hole so I'm not sure why I was sent one. Not pleased at all.
8084,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Two Stars Not impressed unique styles has a better fit actually are slimming and better quality
8085,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Pill It pilled like crazy
8086,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Way to big
8087,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Don‚Äôt buy These were horrible! They are just a tank top. Holds nothing in! Wish it wasn‚Äôt so late to get my money back
8088,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Poorly made. The seaming came undone after two days
8089,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,See through You can see straight through them if you do any bending / squatting.
8090,2,B0B16Q1854,0,quality  fine The product quality is fine but not great
8091,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not enough compression Not enough compression. My husband didn‚Äôt like it.
8092,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Would be a great purchase, except it arrived with the seams already ... Would be a great purchase,except it arrived with the seams already ripped. Will be sewing it before I can even wear it."
8093,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Too tight They sleeve r too tight<br /> I love Colo i wish it fits
8094,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"I like the wicking type material and that they are very ... I like the wicking type material and that they are very fitted however they run short and small, feel like I'm constantly pulling it down. Wish they were longer."
8095,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Try a bigger size Good quality but it feels a bit snuggled
8096,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"The top of the dress is a little odd in ... The top of the dress is a little odd in fit.  Under the armpit, the fabric sticks out in the front or back so it looks a little big."
8097,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Great for working out, not longer than a standard tank. It is not as long as what I was wanting."
8098,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"If you are looking for quality, this isn't the hoodie you want. But it's cheap... Very cheap product. Rough cotton that will likely shrink to size, cheap zipper that feels like it will break easily, but nothing fancy at all. This is not the hoodie I was looking for."
8099,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,The material is really nice and comfy. I should have ordered small. The medium is way larger than expected. Had to check the inside tag for a mistake.
8100,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Loose leggings The tummy control area was loose . Didn‚Äôt have different fabric to hold or control anything . Felt the same as rest of the leggings . Just leggings . Not tummy control at all
8101,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Shorter than expected Purchased these in white and they were perfect but when I went back and purchased these in black, they were significantly shorter (same fit otherwise, but, shorter)."
8102,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Stretchy comfiest and warm ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I like the product but I thought it was cotton it‚Äôs polyester but it‚Äôs comfortable and feels nice and warm to wear..
8103,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not like the picture Not as advertised..... doesn‚Äôt look like the pic
8104,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not what it looks like in the picture I dislike this product because the one I received looked like it was used and someone returned it plus it was missing the drawstring as well.
8105,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Compression Tanks Fits larger than expected so the compression part really doesn't help much.
8106,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,This Dress was a Mess! Not at all what was advertised!  Too small in every way. I made sure I ordered the correct size according to the company‚Äôs size chart. The seems were bunched and crooked. It‚Äôs just not good quality.
8107,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Very thin, too clingy Did not fit like in the picture at all"
8108,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Depends on what you want it for.... Here's the deal:<br />I bought a Small and a Medium, which is my normal size.<br />The body fits true to size, especially after machine washing and drying. The arms are voluminous to say the least. Don't size down. The body will end up too tight and the sleeves will still be too loose. So Small goes back. Those of you who wanted to wear this as athletic wear...why? There are better options like wicking poly fleece's. For those of you who wanted a casual piece of sportswear (this does have the classic v-inset at the neck), take it to a seamstress, tailor, your Mom, or fire up the sewing machine and slim the sleeves down, after you wash and dry it. It'll work just fine for your needs."
8109,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Looks great but not ideal for people who sweat. The material used is not moisture wicking. So if you sweat like I do during workouts your tank is going to look like you entered a wet tshirt contest. Alternatively, if you don't sweat much, these tanks look and fit great. I'm 6-1, 230, athletic build. XL worked perfect."
8110,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Three Stars Im 5'7 125 pounds. Sleeves were too short and too wide
8111,1,B09M6X79V9,0,to small I am not that big yet these shirts were still to small as with all the clothing I have bought. I have to get XX or larger and still to small. I am only a large
8112,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Thick girls keep searching If u have a itty bitty booty these are the pants for u ! Big booty gals stay away
8113,1,B07XD71F1H,0,See through Really wanted to like this dress but sent it back because it was so thin.
8114,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Size down Good quality but ran large
8115,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars My coat still fits over
8116,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Just don't buy!! I ordered a small I'm 5 5 110 they are so big they would fit my 200lb husband! The logo feels like it was painted on..save your money!
8117,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Little compression Nice fabric, runs a big. Little compression<br />I would not buy for the compression."
8118,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Its meh pro: great colors<br />con: patchy and sticky
8119,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Runs Large If you are looking for a snug fit, I suggest going down a size. I ordered according to the size chart. My tops fit like blouses. I had to give them to someone.<br />The colors are beautiful, however."
8120,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Color is Off Quality if fine, the color is off from the picture.<br />This sweatshirt is the color of a pink highlighter not a darker pink like the picture shows. I bought it to make a darker pink bottom and it does not."
8121,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Like wearing a garbage bag Too long.  Baggy around the waist.  Fits my chest alright, but doesn‚Äôt accentuate it.  Overall, I just didn‚Äôt find them very flattering."
8122,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Poor quality The dress is beautiful but after wearing twice (not even washing it), the fabric looked like if I had had it for years. I had to thow it away. Too bad, the fit was great and the design beautiful!"
8123,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Cute but to snug for layers I like the pattern and color. I usually wear a 2 x and its baggy after reading comments I went up 2 sizes and still fits more like a tshirt than a sweater. may give to my mother it is a better fit for her and she wears a large...this is a 4x.
8124,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,I returned back Not bad but I don‚Äôt like it
8125,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,No good I don‚Äôt like these at all. Cheap shiny looking. Way too tight in waist and huge in thighs. Look cheap.
8126,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not what I expected This shirt was very tight for an xl. The material is like a netting. However breathable but not soft and does rub the skin. My chest size is 47
8127,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars to big in arms
8128,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Cute but runs large I wanted to love this but ended up returning it bc it was so large on me.
8129,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Sizing issues This garment is sooooooo badly sized I can't believe it!  In fact, I must say that I repeatedly run into this problem with clothes bought on Amazon.  I contend that this dress, in any shop in America would be labeled &#34;medium&#34; and a rather scant medium at that.<br />I just keep wondering why it is so hard to create a standard size chart so that the clothes we buy on line, and can't try on.  It is CRAZY!"
8130,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,No tiene presi√≥n No tiene comprensi√≥n
8131,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Don‚Äôt do it Terribly disappointed. I got what I paid for, I guess. THIS IS NOT SWEATER MATERIAL, despite what some reviews say. It‚Äôs a cotton/polyester shell with all polyester sleeves. I waited quite a while for delivery also. Very cheap swap meet item that will be more trouble to return."
8132,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Three Stars Its seems much smaller for the its size.
8133,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Not what it looks like online, very deceiving Looks complete different in person, very deceiving"
8134,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs very very small I wanted to like these but run very very small<br />They do seem to be well made though.
8135,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not enough compression Avatar the product across it didn‚Äôt have enough compression.
8136,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"not a dress, a coverup for the beach This is entire see through. I was not expecting the material to be so thin"
8137,3,B09M6X79V9,0,If they fit right they'd be very comfortable but they're two sizes too small I suggest you order two sizes bigger than you actually need
8138,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Get a bigger size if you have a long torso They were a little short, but I have a long torso."
8139,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,Cute Just too baggy to work out in but quality was great
8140,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not what I expected Sadly this is not at all what I had expected. The color looks nothing at all like advertised and it feels a bit cheap. I‚Äôm returning it sadly but if the color had been right I would have just kept it.
8141,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Quality control issues Big hole in it
8142,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Smaller size They run way too big
8143,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not fleece I wanted a fleece sweatshirt for my dad and this is just a plain cotton sweatshirt. Not sure what they think fleece is but I can assure you it‚Äôs not this. Very disappointed.
8144,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Ok Brought this pair and One other both pairs the drawstring come out
8145,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Runs 1 size smaller order up Order up. Runs small
8146,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression This is not shapewear or compression. It‚Äôs a regular tank top. Don‚Äôt waste your money here.
8147,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not advertised color Not color exoected...not hot pink at all disappointed
8148,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Look closely Not exactly I thought it would look like. So that was my mistake.
8149,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Cheap, unflattering I ordered an XL. The shirt and sleeves were too short while the waist was loose. The material is cheap, and the way the seams taper up and out made me look like an inverted triangle. Returned."
8150,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Runs small and way too short Based on the size guide, an XS would fit a 26 waist. I‚Äôm a 24 but I figured it might be close enough, but these actually run WAY small and even the extra small was too small for me when it should have been larger based on the description. On top of that they were not full length and were actually closer to capris. To be fair the quality seems good and the material is nice, but I wouldn‚Äôt buy this unless you have very short legs and be aware you should be sizing up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 around 115 for reference."
8151,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Sometimes, you get what you pay for. This was cheap and basically looked it. I no longer own it."
8152,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Dress is short in the front There is a V cutout in the front of the dress.<br />I expected the dress to be long and the same length all around the dress but the front is shorter than the rest of the dress.<br />What‚Äôs advertised in the picture is not what I received.
8153,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"Cute But Cheaply Made Bought this for my daughter‚Äôs cat birthday party and she absolutely loved it. Worked great for that purpose. However after only a couple of wears and washes, the bands on the edges of the arm holes began to tear off. Would only recommend as a one time use dress due to the many unique designs."
8154,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Two Stars This fit like an XL size. Unacceptable, disappointing."
8155,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,It is super cute but not true to size and runs a ... It is super cute but not true to size and runs a lot shorter than shown in picture.  It is also a very thin material which most people don't like but i do.
8156,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"great but.... The product fit my daughter perfectly. She is getting ready to go the 9th grade, and she is athletic. She likes to wear jogging pants around the house to relax. These look great and have retained their color after several washings BUT...... they are already splitting at the seams.  Two of the 4 I have bought are splitting at the seam around the calf area and the inside thigh.  Both I can sew up, but we have only had these for a couple of months, so it makes me suspect the quality of the product."
8157,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Fits Well and Comfortable, but with Regular use zipper broke after 4 months.mm After just 4 months of moderate use, the zipper broke, poor quality."
8158,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Short The fabric is nice and these are perfect if you are small in stature but if you are tall (5'8 and up), you might find that these are short in the torso and ride up under clothes."
8159,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"not so satisfied This is an update to my original revue. While the sweatshirt is made nice and fits well, after only being laundered a few times it started to develop pills in the material. Not real happy with it now and will probably relegate it to around the house use only."
8160,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,not the best quality shirt/material. This shirt looked nice the first time I wore it. After one wash and air drying it (I never put my workout shirts in the drier) this shirt got little fuzzes everywhere! Super annoying. Now it has turned into a sleep shirt ahhaha ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èoh well.
8161,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Work shirts These shirts will wprk for what I bought them, which is just to have another layer on under my work uniform. They are comfortable and warm without being too warm. The only thing that I dont like is the length of the torso on the shirt. It tends to ride up and doesn't want to stay down. I've had to stretch it out so it'll stay. But otherwise, not a bad but."
8162,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,No hap This is the worst item I have ever bought from amazon... I can't give this item no star or if I could I would...<br />Not happy at all<br />üò†üò°üò†üò°
8163,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,The size said small but ran big Kind of big but it's fine
8164,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Ew cheap fabric did a jail make them or something It looked like someone made there first shirts ever I wouldn‚Äôt do it it was all wrong the style  the fabric the length the feel just no not all
8165,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Small Small
8166,3,B0B16Q1854,0,I like them but they were to short I‚Äôm 5ft7 I like them but I have to wear them extremely low on my hips in order for them not to be too short. I‚Äôm 5ft 7
8167,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Shiny material not sporty or flattering It was true to fit but a bit shorter than the picture and the material was shinyüò©.  Cotton more comfortable in this heat.
8168,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Thin fabric and not worth the money The fabric is thin like what‚Äôs the point just wear a sports bra. I was hoping to wear this at the gym or running errands but it‚Äôs super thin and unattractive. Stuck with it so I‚Äôll just wear in the house in the summer.
8169,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Quality has gone downhill. I have been purchasing this sweatshirt for many years, and for a long time when I purchased replacements, the quality was consistent. However, in the last 5 years or so, the quality has gone downhill rapidly. I returned this recent purchase for poor quality, which is a first. Apparently, it is an end of an era for Russell's great quality sweatshirts. Bummer."
8170,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,One Star Poor quality and inaccurate size
8171,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not flattering The material is scratchy and uncomfortable. The compression on the waist is weird. The compression part only compressed half of the tummy and you‚Äôre left with a sucked in waist and your fupa bulding out from under. Considering I have a small frame and don‚Äôt have any lower belly issues these leggings definitely gave me a complex.
8172,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"They sent me the wrong size They fit my daughter and she likes them, but they‚Äôre honestly not that flattering, she‚Äôs going to keep them as pj pants.  No stretch."
8173,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,large fit way to big
8174,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Ordered my usually size. Got a large that fits like a small. No stretch, a large fits like a small. Will not order again."
8175,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not what I expected This sweatshirt needs to be longer in the body. It‚Äôs too short
8176,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Sheer Material I was excited to try these on, but was disappointed to see how sheer these were. The only thing I liked about the leggings was the compression. I bought the navy blue ones in a medium (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 145lbs). I do have a fuller posterior, and the leggings were see through before checking to see if they were squat proof. The material is very thin. I will be investing in a higher quality pair that doesn‚Äôt show my rear."
8177,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Cheaply made Like I wear a 4x I bought a 5 x it is so small and thin there is no way it'll keep me warm
8178,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"The smell is absolutely horrible. I like everything about it but the smell.  I immediately washed it four times, by itself so the smell would not transfer to other items, and it still had a very strong, harsh chemical smell.  Finally put into the dryer with several dryer sheets after it was already dry so it wouldn't shrink from drying, aired it outdoors afterward, before the smell dissipated.  Fair warning."
8179,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Dress came in today and I found a rip right ... Dress came in today and I found a rip right in the middle seam that runs up the front of the dress
8180,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Weird sleeve length. Overall small. I‚Äôm a 36D bust, 27 inch waist, 38 inch hips.<br /><br />I followed the sizing chart and bought the corresponding size to my measurements. When I tried the shirt on the bust was very tight, the waist was pretty tight, and the arms were several inches too short. I did not end up wearing these to work out as I was obviously returning them. The fabric did feel as though it would be good for moisture wicking. I would recommend sizing up in these unless you want a compression look. And I would not recommend for anybody with average to long arms unless you are looking for in above the wrist cut off."
8181,2,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Size is runs smaller I like the material and all. But it is like 2 sizes smaller than the size stated.
8182,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,It's okay I don't know that I would classify these as compression shirts.  They're thin and tight fitting but compression....eh not really.
8183,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Flattering and fitted....however I bought these to wear under my scrubs and they are so comfortable! They fit snug and stay in place. Light smooth athletic-feeling material as well. I wash with cool/warm water and throw in the dryer after with my other items and no issues.<br />Update sept 2022--- after only wearing the white tank one day a week for about 6 weeks, the thread on the strap came apart and the shirt fell apart from that seam. I'm pretty disappointed. The black and grey seem to be doing alright at this time."
8184,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"but not bad for the price My daughter loves it.  It does run a bit small, but not bad for the price."
8185,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Cheap feel and appearance not worth the $$ The fabric is cheap and the print is faded. The craftsmanship is very low quality. I should have returned it immediately
8186,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not very compression Feels nice and comfortable just not very compression
8187,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Short Short
8188,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Ok cut material didn't work for me. Odd feeling material. I'll pass. Used once removed quickly. Donated.
8189,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Three Stars I ordered a size bigger and it is still a little small but it is cute
8190,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Super tight waist band The waist is WAY too tight and uncomfortable.
8191,2,B0B16Q1854,0,I did not get my package I found it it was hidden I like it
8192,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Blah! Don‚Äôt waste your money for the name!!! The puma sweat pants are way more comfortable, cheaper, and much warmer. These came with holes where the tie is around the waist. And they are not comfortable"
8193,2,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Cheap looking line angling across shirt in two places. Didn't notice when I purchased these shirts until I received them, they have two uneven lines going at a weird angle across the entire front of the shirt, looks like the shirts were put together with 3 pieces of material (cheap look). If it wasn't for the ugly stitching lines they would be good workout shirts the fit and materiel was nice."
8194,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Three Stars The material was not good
8195,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"cheaply made, not worth the money. Bought this for my son, the length in the arms is good, the waist is a bit baggy. The shoulders are droopy and present him to be a bit out of shape. I thought this would have higher quality stitching but its pulled everywhere."
8196,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"NOT COMPRESSION GEAR Bought for my husband who had a surgery and needed compression on his chest. This is a big joke. Material is so lax and stretchy it doesn‚Äôt compress a thing! Basically I should have just put a t shirt on him, would have had the same effect. Not a good product, should not be called compression shirts."
8197,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Very thin material Kinda odd with the long string to tie. It‚Äôs very thin material and it faded after one wash.
8198,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression These are not compression. They are kind of fitted but really stretchy and thin. If you have lumps.and bumps you are trying to conceal, this is not the shirt for you. I wish the material was a little more structured."
8199,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Russell brand quality has declined This jacket was to replace one just like it that I bought years ago and was recently damaged. However, the new one may look the same it is not. Russell is now using a thinner and rougher feeling fabric than before. The first one was 80% cotton and 20% poly. The new one is 52% poly and 48% cotton. Would not buy it again."
8200,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Not a medium I am always a medium. This is tighter fitting than it should be for a medium.
8201,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not worth buying. They were huge and not flattering at all. Not a good purchase at all
8202,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Exactly like the picture dose what it is supposed to do Very comfortable I like them
8203,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Alright The design is good and they fit well but they keep super hot.  Will look for cotton next time.
8204,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"I received used tank I just received my set of 3 tank shirts  , and come to open them and the black tank had white deodorant marks all over it , how disgusting !!! Will be sending back ASAP"
8205,1,B0B16Q1854,0,TERRIBLE Quality !  Don't waste your money . Bought these last year. They were great. Purchased again & they are Absolutely Awful ! Fabric is rough & scratchy on my skin. No stretch. The fabric looks just as cheap as it feels.  They will be returned. Save your money !
8206,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Me llego manchada Me llego la camisa blanca manchada.
8207,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Flying squirrel The arms of this hoodie are super huge and baggy and it‚Äôs kinda short. One user said it was like a flying squirrel hoodie and I will have to agree with that user. Sent it back with no issues though so that was nice. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and 150 lbs and it was way too short. I think this hoodie would work well for someone 5‚Äô6 and shorter.
8208,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Cheap material This sweater feels VERY A CHEAP and it's not that comfortable. I wouldn't recommend this.
8209,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Muy largas y anchas Muy largas y anchas
8210,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Nice color and shape but a bit lightweight Good for the price but quite lightweight.  I have not worn them to the gym as yet.  Need to wear a sport bra with them for sure.
8211,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Extremely Small Works as an underlayer, compression shirt but runs very small.  Normally wear XL, ordered 2XL and fits like second skin."
8212,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Fell apart in washer/dryer before even wearing Though I found a cute summer lounge dress for relaxing days. so cheaply made I could never wear it. Destroyed in 1st wash.
8213,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Super sheer and tighter than expected. For the price, it's hard to find things to knock on this purchase. Especially with name brand alternatives costing as much as they do, this was acceptable. Definitely tighter than I anticipated, and thinner in the fabric than I was expecting. I'm 6'2&#34; and 200 pounds (size 32 waist) and an XL was a struggle to get on and off, but wasnt uncomfortabl while on. Also, you'd think that this was sent via pack mule. I mean, good god. This literally took almost a month to recieve. Thank God I wasn't ordering insulin from these guys."
8214,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Doesn't compress as expected. I was looking for something to wear as an under shirt and compress my belly a little. Well a little is All it did. So I am disappointed in the product
8215,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Stained One of the shirts came with a stain on it.  I hope they're durible becasue i ended up with 2 for the price of 3
8216,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"TERRIBLE THE QUALITY IS TERRIBLE, IT FEELS LIKE IM WEARING CARDBOARD! SO SORRY I ORDERED IT, BUYERS BEWARE, CAME PACKED TERRIBLE"
8217,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Good attempt, but not quite workout approved. Bought these in the grey and the red marl in an xs and s respectively. The red were really more of a tangerine color and were pretty see through. Definitely could not squat at the gym in these. Material was thin and not as compressive as I'd like. The xs was a touch too small for me (kinda as expected). For reference I am 5'6"" about 135 with longer legs and a shorter torso. In order to get the contouring dots to hit me in the right areas, I had to hike the pants up pretty high. The small did fit fairly well, however I felt like the waistband didn't hit me in a flattering place so I returned them."
8218,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Disappointing color was not as vibrant as in the picture Didn't care for it not as pretty as it is in the picture which is a problem with Amazon tried to return it it was too late
8219,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Didn't Recieve what was advertised There is NOTHING about this product that is compression. Plain nylon mesh tank top. Nothing special about it. Buy another product.
8220,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"falls apart in wash these were great at first, but they all started to fall apart after about three washes. DO NOT waste your money for three wears!"
8221,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Muy peque√±o Buena calidad y precio. Pero muy peque√±o
8222,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Makes your body look snatched I love these. They are super stretchy and make your body look good. The only thing I will say is it does sometimes give a bit of camel toe/sits off in the front when you are working out. Overall, I love these.<br /><br />Edit: I stopped wearing them after a couple months. They started fitting weird in the crotch and kept rolling down. They weren‚Äôt very good to work out in and would show sweat marks."
8223,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Xs is like a medium Runs big
8224,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Disappointed in quality Returned, poor stiching poor matching dots"
8225,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Stiches Love the material love the dress only down fall are the stickes it looks like it inside out that how bad the sticker are noticeable over am love the dress other than that but she's going to wear for her birthday
8226,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not as shown These are not tank tops  I received sleeveless shirts  They are good for what they are and useable but thought I was ordering as shown in pic
8227,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not for larger bodies I love the idea of these. I like the material but they run small. The compression is amazing. They lack pockets which sucks imo. But I returned mine because they rolled down as soon as I put them on. I've had two kids, I have a pouch but I'm mostly blocky so I was surprised that they rolled so easily. I will probably repurchase after I slim down."
8228,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"NOT COMPRESSION!!!!! They are comfy, but definitely not compression. Works for what I needed it for tho."
8229,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Three Stars Color is different than expected
8230,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Flimsy Not great work out tops. I returned them
8231,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Poor zipper Zipper itself very sharp and expected operation too difficult. Catched on itself, not reasonably smooth"
8232,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Check sizes I usually wear an xl in most clothes.  These are way to tight.  I recommend getting a size larger than you usually do.  Besides that the shirts seem to be well made
8233,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Nope Nice dress but not for the price. Cheap material
8234,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cute but fit very small These looked soo good, but they were very tight. I guess try to order a size it 2 up"
8235,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"So disappointing The front of dress is the back. The back is cut as the front of the dress. Can't use the pockets because of how the dress is cut. So sad because the fabric is amazing. I have to go to a seamstress to cut the front of the dress to match the back, which changes the design of the dress."
8236,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not for slimmer people Item looks good and is warm but bunches at the waist. Would be a good fit for someone without a flat stomach.
8237,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Buy a size up It was an ok fit
8238,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Two Stars It was &#34;OK&#34;, just didn't fit quite right.  Colors slightly off.  I returned it."
8239,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Soft material Didn‚Äôt like how the string is sewn in and can‚Äôt be removed. They are not bright in color but rather a pale almost dingy look. After first wear/wash the name on leg faded. Would not buy again.
8240,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Three Stars Cute dress, but it runs small. Order up one size."
8241,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Srinks it dried an comes snallrgen rhe size it smaller that the size it say an got lent ball an frizzy quick
8242,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,thin and bad quality The shirts are really thin and the quality seem to be poor
8243,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,do not buy it. it looks much better on the website than it actually is.
8244,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Ideal for summer
8245,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,I forgot about the dress as I left it in the packaging and was not pleased with how it is sewn The material of the dress in front's seam does not match up with the pattern.  I received this last spring and left on a trip.  I forgot about the dress as I left it in the packaging and was not pleased with how it is sewn.
8246,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not a good product the cloth quality is bad. fitting size is not good at all.
8247,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Different Color the Advertised This is NOT a neon pink it‚Äôs a bubble gum pink color. Was so disappointed that I ordered this needing the neon color shown and getting a light pink instead...
8248,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Three Stars A nice, light, summer dress that fit as expected."
8249,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Runs a tad small, fabric too thin Fabrics is too thin. I got it to work out in. I would expect these to be form fitting (which they are) but still hold things in just a little. I got a large. I always wear a large. But have lost a little weight and am getting closer to a medium. This shirt fit like a medium, and the fabric is so thin, that it shows every roll, and imperfection."
8250,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Eh I purchased a similar item with another seller and this one does not suck in my stomach the way the other tights did. These tights also roll down while working out, which can be annoying. I'm not sure if I would be purchasing more since the quality feels cheap."
8251,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Look some more Run a little big. They sent out last minute could reach customer service. It‚Äôs like spandex material, so over priced. Not happy how long it took. Waste of money in my eyes."
8252,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Great shape and material but the size is off. I really love this thank top but the size is very off. My chest circumference is 43 inches and the thank top was very loose. The L size was still quite loose. I had to by a M size for a more form fitting look.
8253,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Disappointed Disappointed, after the first used the thread begin to come out‚Ä¶ because of the price I paid, I was expecting something better."
8254,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not really a compression shirt Maybe because of my size or I had to high of expectations but the fit on this shirt is just a tight tank top not really a compression shirt. I'm a big guy at 6'2 350 with a bit of a gut. I wanted a compression shirt just to look better in dress shirts for work but I have to wear all 3 of these shirts to get the desired effect I was hoping for. Still a great undershirt but don't buy if youre looking g for a compression/slimming shirt.
8255,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Far too small I ordered two sizes up from what I wear in hopes of getting a slightly looser fit but they're still too small. I have never had this problem with size variation before. I checked the tag because I assumed they sent me the wrong size. NOPE
8256,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Falling apart at the seams I love the dress, but it‚Äôs starting to fray at the seems a t a little over a month from purchase, approximately 6 wears."
8257,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,One Star It looks like the arms are embroidered... they aren't.  Looks cheap... and it was.. I would not recommend.
8258,1,B0B16Q1854,0,They are NOT soft at all! They are not soft or comfortable.
8259,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"NOT high waisted These fit ok, HOWEVER, they are not high waisted. I‚Äôm 5ft 3in and they barley went above my belly button. The top kept rolling down and they ride up in the most uncomfortable/ unflattering ways possible. Wish they have worked because they fit perfect for length which is hard to find for me."
8260,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not as advertised at all. Top is a sheer ... Not as advertised at all. Top is a sheer ill cut piece of fabric, which has large polka dots. &#34;Lining&#34; is short and cut larger than the top layer. Not low-v cut. Short straps. And pockets are just below my bust line. Awful purchase. Beware! I ordered after I looked through the other reviews and saw all the cute pictures of the product others had gotten. Thats not what I got!"
8261,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Comfy but not built for exercise. I really loved the look and feel of these leggings but after only having them on for 5 minutes the fabric began to catch on everything. I thought they would have a thicker more durable material like leggings but that is not the case. I returned because I don't think they will survive one gym session without looking totally destroyed.
8262,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Nice but short Nice shorts but a little short.
8263,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,All 3 are different sizes The shirts are all sized slightly different  Smaller than expected.
8264,1,B009R09Z8W,0,No llego el producto No llego el producto
8265,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Size up Like the design but run small.
8266,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Hole Came with a small hole on the front of the shirt that appeared to be glued back together from the inside.
8267,2,B07XD71F1H,0,"Unflattering This was cheaply made. See through and unflattering, only buy if you‚Äôre super skinny"
8268,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Very poor quality, but oh so comfy!!!!! I LOVE these pants, I have ordered 3 pairs and none fit correctly, I keep trying though.  Last pair had the pocket sewed shut, first pair had no butt, was impossible to pull them up all the way."
8269,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not as I expected The picture was deceiving and the word compression should not be part of the description. They are very thin and loose.
8270,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"dont trust the pic bought these for my daughter in laws , no way do they fit like the picture . misleading"
8271,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Re-ordered it twice. My regular size is XXL for ... Re-ordered it twice. My regular size is XXL for last 5-6 years. When received first item it was at list 5X! Returned it and order XL. Came in with same result! The difference was only the lable on it! Now waiting on Large size. When received L size (size I was wearing at college!) it was good..
8272,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression at all These are absolutely awful and have no compression at all very deceiving. Fits like a regular tank but it is silky not cotton.
8273,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small The tank tops run extremely small.
8274,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Comfortable but didn't fit as well as I wanted. I got these hoping for compression type fit.  I ordered a medium since I am generally a medium in most things, they fit fairly loosly on me.  I should have got a small.  They are comfortable and I will certainly use them for the gym, i just wanted them to be tighter. My ribcage and waist are fairly small but I am a 36DDD."
8275,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Cheap quality These are ok tank tops, but the quality of them isn't very good.  The strings are all starting to come out only after a few wears."
8276,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Piled after 1 wear I bought this in several colors and loved it but find it piled after a wear or two. Sadly, cheap {:"
8277,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Runs SUPER small! Order at least 2 times bigger than normal
8278,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Two Stars Claims to be compression fabric but is not.
8279,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Very shiny material Material sucked
8280,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Made backwards!!! This could be a five-star dress but mine was made backwards. I put it on with the tag in the back.. The seem was in the front, and the pockets backwards. Easy fix, turn it around right?! The adjustment straps are in the front now along with the tag... Okay, I'll cut the tag out and cover the straps with a jacket but it is a $40 inconvenience."
8281,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Quality was bad compared to the Russell hoodie I purchased in a retail store. Cheap... I'm not saying it's bad but it definitely doesn't match the quality of materials and construction of a Russell hoodie I got from a retail store. This was just a cheap hoodie except for the tag. I was trying to replace a Russell hoodie I had last season but this one if definitely a step down from the last one.
8282,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Slightly shorter than expected I just got these today I needed something more comfortable to wear to work and they feel like they are going to keep me cool but the only thing is that they are slightly short but I think I can make it work
8283,2,B0B16Q1854,0,It's not soft the fabric is very scratchy. Very cheap. But what do you expect for 20bucks. The feeling of fabric. Very cheap and a scratchy feeling
8284,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Tie on top of shoulder There's a side tie on top of the dress that adjusts the dress. It's weird and awkward. I haven't really adjusted the dress yet with the tie. The dress seems fine once i can perfect the tie.
8285,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Okay Colors are nice they are just not super fitted like I expected
8286,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not compression shirts Elastic, sure. Form-fitting, definitely. Compression? No."
8287,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Three Stars Read above
8288,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Okay for around the house and beach wear.
8289,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Didn‚Äôt like I ordered a size bigger than I wear and it fits like a size smaller than I am .
8290,3,B09M6X79V9,0,They ARE compression shirts Very nice colors! I sized up for a looser fit but still they were way too tight. I sent them back and got a refund.
8291,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"For the money, a res Not at all plush inside."
8292,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not durable Product seems are already coming apart after 2 washings. Bought 3, one is already unwearable."
8293,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not fitting Not really compressing as I feel it should
8294,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Needs Thicker Material Too Thin Material
8295,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Very very small I ordered a size larger than I typically wear and I could not get these past my knees! Returned them.
8296,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"I‚Äôm an XL. Purchased a L. It doesn‚Äôt compress. It just feels like a loose undershirt. Have tried many brands. After reading all the reviews, I gave these a try. If you are looking for a compression shirt, skip these. I could get more compression from a Hanes tank top."
8297,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression. Not compression at all. I am 5'6"" 170 I ordered a medium not tight at all. Super soft and comfortable."
8298,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Pretty good for the price, but a few things you should know It's a cheap dress, so you shouldn't be shocked that the quality isn't great.  But, for my needs (a costume), it was fine.  Color is accurate.  Hem was a little uneven.  Pockets.  Soft, stretchy, and a bit see-through."
8299,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Poorly made Wore them twice and began ripping where draw string is and has been getting larger.  Very comfortable but poorly made . Get them if you want disposable clothing .
8300,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Don't bother You could see right through it. Thinnest material know to the human race was used to make this.
8301,2,B009R09Z8W,0,fits awkwardly fits really awkwardly all over the place. The neck was a bit high and tight. for a size large i thought the length was okay but the bottom of the  hoodie was a bit tight while the midsection was too big. im 5'5 and 200 lbs.
8302,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Nothing like the photo. Ordered 3 sizes up, still not good. Just awful. I wear a large and actually ordered the xxxl and it was still too short. Fabric is cheap and does not look like the picture. Spend a bit more and get something you will like."
8303,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Pattern is cute. But the hem line-cut rides up ... Pattern is cute.  But the hem line-cut rides up in the rear.  Not flattering if you are somewhat tall.
8304,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Low quality Low quality
8305,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Snarled easily These are nice shirts. They fit how I expected but after the first wash this is how it came out
8306,3,B09M6X79V9,0,... length athough not exposing my waist I would really like it longer to near Way too short on the length athough not exposing my waist I would really like it longer to near hips
8307,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Too lose all around. I kept one but sent the others back. I miss the all cotton version.
8308,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Ok Ok but long
8309,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Fool me once... I bought the 3 pack both times.  First time all 3 had treads coming apart.  Second time same thing.  I really like the tanks when they stay together, which is why I bought a second time... Shame on me. :("
8310,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend The fit is horrible. There‚Äôs not enough length in the crotch area. Therefore, the pants just fall down in the back."
8311,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"This does not run as small as reviewed I am not a fan. It is a bit short, and the cuffs are really small. I expected a better quality garment."
8312,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,A bit oversized in my opinion. Wasn‚Äôt expecting the product to be skin tight or anything - ordered a small and it seems the fit in the midsection is extremely billowy.
8313,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"2 star bc it's a great bathing suit cover up but purchased as a dress Not the same dress as the picture. Mine is short in the front and long in the back with large pokadotas not small as the picture shows. It is also cheaply made and somewhat see through, 2 star bc it's a great bathing suit cover up but purchased as a dress."
8314,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Just does not fit that comfortably. Warm The length is a bit odd. Tends to rise up from the bottom. Just does not fit that comfortably. Warm.
8315,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Cute style and pattern but... The side seams totally threw off the design continuity at the hemline. Fortunately I have a friend who is an amazing seamstress and she was able to remedy it otherwise I would have sent it straight back.
8316,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Worth it I like how it keeps you cool and it's great for working out
8317,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Fine Fine
8318,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Three Stars It wasnt vompletely sewn so I  had to take it to a tailor, so it cost me another $15."
8319,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Super cute dress!! Just should've gotten a small. Other than that perfect!! But I never got the small :(
8320,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Still haven‚Äôt been able to wear it. I wish ... Still haven‚Äôt been able to wear it. I wish it was bigger in the bust so it‚Äôd fit. And I‚Äôm not too heavy.
8321,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Runs small Size up
8322,1,B09M6X79V9,0,The material is not what I was expecting. It‚Äôs a shiny material and not flattering . Did not like the fit or material. Looks really cheap.
8323,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very See Through. Not what I expected. They are very see-through and semi-fit. I am seeking a more form fitting top and I thought via advertisement these were it, but they were not. I ordered a large and they were too small, short wise."
8324,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Comfortable but not soft Fitz's expected very comfortable, love the pockets, not very soft at all. Fabric is itchy and stiff on the outside but soft enough on the inside. Not the best, not the greatest, not too bad, I give it a 3 out of 5"
8325,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Disappointed There were short through the torso and provided zero compression. Very dissatisfied
8326,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not the greatest quality Stitching came undone after only a few wears
8327,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"NO tummy control! The waist band is narrower than most leggings I own, so tummy control is not great. My lower tummy is not compressed when I wear them at the waist, and if I lower them to cover the lower tummy area, they cause a bit of a muffin top. They also roll at the waist during any work out and I am constantly unrolling them. I would not recommend these if you are seeking tummy control."
8328,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too small tank Not good
8329,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,I'm 5'6 and weigh 153lbs. I read a review ... I'm 5'6 and weigh 153lbs. I read a review that if you are about my size a large would fit just right but I would have preferred an x-L instead.
8330,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"big! so I usually wear a size small. I ordered an extra small because I wanted a tighter fit , however, the extra small was big on me. I'm glad I didn't order my usual size. if you are a smaller size person, don't count on these being form fitting at all. not only was it loose, but short as well."
8331,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Two Stars Super duper tight! No matter what size you wear they will fit skin tight.
8332,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"NOT workout material Whoever said these were a gym shark dupe was SO wrong. These are nowhere near the quality or even the same texture as gym shark leggings. I got black, and they are definitely NOT squat proof. They are comfortable for day-to-day wear and flattering, but if you're looking for good workout leggings, save your money!"
8333,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,It's not cotton it's synthetic and the slip that was sewn only kind of underneath the top layer is just as flimsy and terrible s Wasn't anything I expected it to be. It's not cotton it's synthetic and the slip that was sewn only kind of underneath the top layer is just as flimsy and terrible stitching all over
8334,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Did not stay put The shirts tended to shift upward to expose the mid drift.
8335,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Pretty but not best material This is a beautiful dress but very curve hugging and the material is stretchy but fades if it‚Äôs stretched even the slightest. I have a DD chest and it‚Äôs a good thing the top part is mostly the light colored pattern. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and about 158 and the medium fits well.
8336,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"NOT BAD I am 5ft 9/148lbs.<br />I like the flow of the dress and the airiness. Perfect for summer. And the finish is good. The only issue I have is in the picture it does not reflect that it is a High low dress, so the front was shorter that I expected. It's okay, just different from I envisioned it would be."
8337,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Legs a tad short The legs are a bit short. I don't have terribly long legs and these are more capris length on me. Other than that they are great. Color stays. Squat proof and great control top.
8338,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Thin Very thin, too thin to call them ""sweatpants"""
8339,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Other than that the garments are terrific. I owned 2 of these and in the neck tag they said the size was &#34;medium&#34;, so I ordered 3 more mediums, but upon arrival they were far too large.  I then ordered smalls, and they fit exactly as the mediums I currently own.  Maybe they changed sizing parameters because people in general are getting larger?  Other than that the garments are terrific."
8340,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Eh! I bought these to workout in. I liked them because of the T back design but they are not very flattering on me. I use them to workout so who cares right?  They are OK I guess. I bought them in a Medium.
8341,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,It‚Äôs ok. Not great Slightly ill-built. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it but something is off with the fit of this tee. I‚Äôll still deal since it‚Äôs just a workout shirt but not quite right. It is true to size and not too clingy on the midsection.
8342,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not a compression shirt I wanted a compression shirt to smooth out my body lines, but it does make for a nice undershirt"
8343,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Comfortable to wear. The color is amazing. The material is shear so a slip underneath will be required. I am a little disappointed that the dress did shrink a little  after the first washing in cold water. It is incredibly comfortable to wear.
8344,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Did not find them compression wear. Nice tank tops but I found the run too large to be considered compression wear. I listened to others and ordered next size up and that was mistake. I will keep as I like them as daily tank tops but definitely not compression wear‚Äô
8345,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression Not nearly long enough for a longer torso, not tight enough to to be called compression"
8346,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Singing ‚ÄúOh no, Oh no no no no‚Äù Tried on this and the material is not all what it‚Äôs cracked up to be. Didn‚Äôt judge it and then wore it all day and it started to tear in multiple spots. I am very disappointed in this dress. Bought it because of the color, style and it had POCKETS üò¢"
8347,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small I got a large but find it very tight and clingy. Great value though.
8348,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Didn‚Äôt like the shape of it Didn‚Äôt fit well. Didn‚Äôt like the shape of it on
8349,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not so oversized I was excited when some reveiws mentioned it was on the larger size. I am usually a S-M but wanted to size up to get a really oversized fit. I have the same brand jersey in red from goodwill in a large so I thought it would be fine. It was not as big as I expected. Should have gotten an XL. Too much to return so I will just have to deal.
8350,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,First set was awesome. Second set was too stretchy and did nothing ... Completely different shirt the second time I ordered it. First set was awesome. Second set was too stretchy and did nothing for me.
8351,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Two Stars Runs very small
8352,3,B09M6X79V9,0,No shaping/tummy support I expected more spandex support and shaping
8353,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not sure yet! I haven‚Äôt tried theses on as of yet but they are not decompression at all so if you want something to hold you in I would not recommend theses.
8354,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Wrong color description The color red is not even close to the color in the picture.  It is similar to the pink color in the other pictures.
8355,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Didn‚Äôt last Great fit but got a run in fabric after wearing twice.
8356,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars size is off
8357,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Love the fit, hate the material I wanted to buy many of these but after a few washes the material starts to ball up. Doesn't stay nice.  Good for only workout pants,  not public."
8358,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression Not compression.  They are just Lycra stretch tanks
8359,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Pilling immediately Started pilling first time worn.
8360,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Too small The product stretches but the size I got did not fit even though I went by the chart.  I suggest getting a size bigger.
8361,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Terrible, but its cheap so what do you expect Cheap material. Does not look good. I have a 42 inch chest and a 29.5 inch waist so my build is very athletic. Normally clothes fit my chest and not my waist and that is fair enough. This just straight up doesnt fit lol."
8362,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not a great fit and no compressi9n at all. Material too thin also To thin and no compression
8363,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Nice but no compression These are nice but unless you order it smaller than you usually wear, there‚Äôs not a lot of compression going on. It‚Äôs just a polyester tank top."
8364,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Doesn't fit well. Doesn't look like the picture at all. The sleeves are baggy and unflattering and sweater part is short and awkward. Not like the picture at all. The colors are the only thing on point.
8365,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Ok It supposed to compress. Suggest to buy one size smaller
8366,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not good I hate them super small short
8367,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cheap flimsy loose-fitting they run super large Super big, and for me I usually have the opposite problem. Super thin, flimsy. Don't like them at all."
8368,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not for Leg Day This are extremely comfortable for the price! However they are definitely not squat proof so not made for a leg day for sure.
8369,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Not what I expected Love the dress not the material.  I was thinking it was cotton but it was polyester blend.  Not good for summer.
8370,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"These are OK I used them for a while and they are ok for what they are. Keep in mind these are not going to be superior to an actual bodybuilder tank top. But they are cheaper and they work. The material is made out of a thin breathable material that‚Äôs very light. If you like that then these are for you. But most bodybuilders like something that is tight in the chest and dresses out at the bottom. So if your looking for a real bodybuilding tank, look elsewhere. üòÅ"
8371,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not a compression garment Light weight, soft tank top. Very thin material. Not any type of compression garment though"
8372,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Runs 4x time the small size, 3x set to give a large a complex I bought this item larger so they would fit.  What I got was sweatpants that a skinny 16 year old would fit in.  Insulted and annoyed.  Worse part is I can't return due to missing the window."
8373,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Don‚Äôt recommend Not great quality
8374,1,B0928FSGGD,0,"Not worth buying!!!! Worst product I had ever bought on Amazon!  Very disappointing!  I bought an extra large, hoping these shirts would fit loosely.  Instead they were the size of a small child‚Äôs shirt!  Crappy material and product was WAY OVER PRICED!!!!!<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
8375,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Two Stars Pretty poor quality, sleeves way to<br />Big and baggy for a medium size."
8376,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Go two sizes up!! I really like it all except I went up a size because I figured it‚Äôd be a little smaller but it‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôve lost some weight otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt have fit, otherwise very comfortable for all day wear under my uniform"
8377,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Comfortable. Low quality. A comfortable well fitting sweater. Lasted one day. I WAS roughhousing, but all the stitches came out and it literally fell apart.<br /><br />*I had purchased 2 for outdoor use. Each of them lasted one day. Wore them hiking... but just wearing a backpack and walking through the brush tore them to shreds. I mean ripped apart with holes and gashes. I wasn't even mad it was so amazing."
8378,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Ok It's ok, but could be a little longer."
8379,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Wrong size sent. Wrong size was sent. The shirts are serviceable,  but do not compress much. They could use to be a bit longer. They will work alright though"
8380,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Comfy but won‚Äôt buy again I‚Äôve had them 6 months and the material is already see through.
8381,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Shrunk after one wash Bought 5 of them, price was good. Husband tried on when we got them, fit perfect, until I washed them. He is tall and thin and likes xl.  Can‚Äôt return because I washed them all before he was to wear them. Order bigger size."
8382,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Order the next size up. This is not gospel Fabric takes some getting used to..it is a bit clingy not cotton material. It's a US company but made in China. XL is not XL.. don't care what anyone says types or takes pictures of. All of my XL tank tops are bigger than this XL tank top therfore this XL tank top requires an XXL to be in the XL family.
8383,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,I received one XL and 1 small when I ordered 2 packs of XL's I ordered 2 packs of XL's and hot 1 XL and 1 pack of small.
8384,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ok I measured myself and they were still too large. The shifts didn‚Äôt stay down while working out and kept sliding around exposing myself.
8385,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Poor quality Poor quality bad fit
8386,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Cheap fabric and construction and looks it. Junk
8387,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Too laaaarge! tooooo large for me
8388,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Poor construction? Cuff on sleeve has a rip in it on 1st wear.
8389,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"short crotch inseam they're ok if you don't have much of a behind, but for curvy ladies these are NOT a good fit. I bought a size larger just in case and the pants are huge around my hips but short on the crotch inseam so when I bend my butt crack shows. Very frustrating."
8390,2,B009R09Z8W,0,It‚Äôs not great It was ok. It wasn‚Äôt very soft and was quite thin. ‚òπÔ∏è
8391,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not a real size to order XL size is like the size of small thing & is so hard to wear
8392,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,I'm 5'2 and this hits mid calf. I'm 5'2 and this hits mid calf. The top is also tight with the cut it is sitting above my hips with the pockets puffing out üòï
8393,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Two out of three Really surprised usually the quality Control is good. Of the three shirts in the pack to fit very well nice and snug and provide compression. The third for some reason is very loose and does not have any elasticity left in it. This just might be a chance occurrence.
8394,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Fit properly Too small
8395,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Average product. Won‚Äôt buy again. It is an average product. A bit on the smaller size and the fabric is also average.
8396,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Love the dress Love the dress; however it was torn under each arm when I received it in the mail. Even so, I love the dress so I'm going to have it repaired. Despite reading the reviews on how cheaply it was made, I still bought it."
8397,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Deceiving material The material is like the red Pennys you used to get in gym class to divide the teams.
8398,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"they're quite comfortable. I only wish they were a little bit ... I thought the compression would be a little tighter, however, they're quite comfortable. I only wish they were a little bit longer as to properly tuck in like an undershirt."
8399,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Fits 2 sizes smaller Its beautiful, fits smaller then expected."
8400,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Good fit except‚Ä¶ Quality is fine. The neck opening is too large and makes for awkward fit.
8401,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Grossly out if proportion It was a 1x...looked like a 4x. Grossly out of proportion...no room for your bottom.
8402,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"No compression These are not compression tanks. Not happy. Will be returning. I‚Äôm a size medium, that‚Äôs the size I ordered, but they are not tight. They are fitted, but not tight like they‚Äôre supposed to be. I also didn‚Äôt realize the material was going to be silky."
8403,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Cute But Flimsy I bought 2 pairs of these sweatpants, one fit great and was even a little big, this rainbow lettering one runs extremely small and short, almost like child sizes.

8404,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Nice. just bigger than my old Russel XL sweatshirts Nice. just bigger than my old Russel XL sweatshirts. They've definitely added  4 plus inches around gut area ,"
8405,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Sheer. Way too long and seams on inner thigh have pulling This is the second pair I have tried from aoxjox. And im very disappointed. I'm 5'5 145 . I ordered a medium. The waist.come up to my boobs. And they're still extra fabric in the legs. The inner thighs had pulling in the stitching before I even tried them on<br /> And they're sheer. I keep seeing great reviews for these. And I LOVE AOXJOX shorts. But  Are awful. Way too ling sheer. And damaged upon arrival. Can't wear.
8406,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"I bought medium Usually I wear a medium. But these were too big in medium. I have ordered a small pair also. I can wear them, because they have a drawstring."
8407,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Where's my Muff Pocket So far a great semi-lightweight Jacket. But I cannot find the Muff Pocket for my Cellphone. False advertising again. Yes it was a selling point for me. As I said in another review on clothing purchased online - It's kinda potluck on receiving exactly what you think you ordered. My fault -Won't order clothing online again.
8408,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"if you carry most of your weight on your stomach this is not for you I was excited for this legging because I heard good things about them, BUT I had to return them and I'll tell you why.<br />PRO: The legging is compressive and snatches your waist and your booty looks very good. The contour is perfect and not over doing it. It's not brushed or soft legging so don't expect it to be. Its just seamless legging.<br /><br />CONS: The waist band is TIGHT. The tightest part of the legging. legging fits me perfectly everywhere, but the tightness of the waist band was a no for me. It was fine, but if you carry weight on your stomach you are just going to have big rolls from the waist band even if the legging fit. SIZE UP!! Not only that sheerness and squat proof on the leggings are different so read the info to see the percentage of sheerness. A darker color may be more sheer than a lighter color, which I don't understand why.<br /><br />COST: Is it worth the cost? $30+? I wouldn't buy it again, but I think it decent for others. I've bought other leggings that is $20+ and I truly think that they are better.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />I think that if you are a girl who has a flat tummy/fit or don't carry most of your weight on your stomach, then this legging would be great for you. For my other girls like me who has some tummy you are just going to have roll or bulges from the waist band or you can try sizing up. Read through the reviews and look at the picture. There was only like one person who I saw that had picture and show how tight the band was. She show that most of her weight was on her stomach and what the legging look like on her.  Try it out if you are not sure, you can always return."

8410,1,B07XD71F1H,0,I don‚Äôt like it the material very cheap This product looks very different in picture than the real ..the price so expensive comparing by material
8411,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Cheap feeling material and sleeves are too short I'm 5'8 and the sleeves were a little too short  but if you are shorter that won't be a problem. The colors were pretty but the material feels really cheap. Overall, usable but I wouldn't recommend them."

They constantly ride up, roll up- I bought for warmth during running- or to sleep in, or to wear under sweaters in winter- but they do not stay put. Even when sleeping- so uncomfortable. I just realized I had them a year later- and noticed them in my drawers- and bummed they never worked out."
8414,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Too small Much smaller than anticipated. Very short in the torso

8417,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Take a Pass on Russell apparel they used to make a very soft cotton product - the quality is going down - seems like a harsher mesh material -
8418,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Doesn‚Äôt fit well, good material. This dress was extremely unflattering, even if I bought a few sizes down I really believe it would look terrible. For the cut of the top it was loose around the armpits and chest, then fit like a glove around my waist, then was really long and large on the bottom. I went with the size chart and with the suggestions of other reviews for sizing. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 160 pounds and got a large. The only good thing about the dress was the material and the design and it came on time and the return was easy and stress free."
8419,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Three Stars The quality is not satisfying!
8420,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Too Small TOOO SMALL
8421,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Too Loose I am 5'5"" and 135lbs, size D bra. Ordered the medium but it's so large on me. I could fit two people inside of it. I would order down a size. Wearing it with a belt does help. Also it's a bit too polka dotty for me. Wish they were smaller dots or not as white."
8422,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Cheep Way to small for my size 14 body. It was very cheeply made returned it the same day
8423,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Wrong size. Received product in a timely manner. Seem to be well made. However, I ordered large. I received two large and one extra large."
8424,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Fits so well and the design is great. Pockets perferct size fir a large cell phone ... UPDATE...stiching in front at the V neck is starting to unravel after only 2 washes.<br /><br />Fits so well and the design is great. Pockets perferct size fir a large cell phone and placed well on the dress.  I am reserving 5 stars for after the 1 1st wash to see how it holds up.
8425,1,B09M6X79V9,0,These shirts do not compress the form. This is an A frame pattern shirt.  Compression shirts do not fit loosely and flow.  I am a size Medium. I purchased a M and thought it would be too tight.  These shirts fit nicely if you like to run with a loose fitting flowing shirt.
8426,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Dress fits as expected however material was a little stiff but after one washing it seemed to soften up.
8427,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Good product, bad service. When my package arrived, it had been nearly destroyed. The bag inside with the shirts was torn and taped back up with the shirts wadded up inside. Instead of receiving 3 shirts, there were 2. I don‚Äôt know who would see that and think it‚Äôs ok to send out. Good shirts, just wish they had been honest."
8428,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,way to small way too tight around the bust area but it looked cute but not on me cuz it wouldn't fit over my chest
8429,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Look elsewhre I picked these up because i thought it would help with posture and slimming. Product does neither infact although it is tight for compression, it is too ahort so i have a hard time keeping this tucked in."
8430,1,B0B16Q1854,0,All semis come undone. Comfort softness and stretch is great seeing sucks
8431,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Cheaply made, but expected It's a little loose at waist. Made very cheaply but it's a $12 top... so to be expected."
8432,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Small The 5x fits like a 1x
8433,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not a compression a shirt. This is just a regular undershirt being marketed as compression shirt. Would definitely not recommend.
8434,3,B009R09Z8W,0,okay okay
8435,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not True to Size These do not run true to size tried one on and went straight back to into the packaging and did the return...
8436,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Did NOT work for me Too small and looks weird. I think it would look better on a very skinny person.
8437,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Hole after wearing them three times I love these and I loved the look of them, but after the third time wearing them I already at a hole in the crotch area!!  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving them a 2."
8438,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Sweat pants. Didn‚Äôt care for the color. Wasn‚Äôt a pretty pink.<br />Didn‚Äôt like the fit.
8439,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,One was great quality material while the other was noticeably cheaper Ordered two packages of these. One was great quality material while the other was noticeably cheaper.
8440,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Read it for yourself :) Horrible quality. I would never pay $20 for these if i was able to actually see and feel the quality before hand. I'd pay $10 for them. $10 is the price you pay for 4 QUALITY fruit of the loom wife beaters. These have NO compression. They are VERY see through and VERY thin. I gave 2 stars because they actually sized it right. I ordered a size and it is the right size. Man, at least they did one thing right."
8441,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"I expected a thicker material like the ones that were sold from ""As seen on ... I expected a thicker material like the ones that were sold from &#34;As seen on TV&#34;. These are nice but I wanted a material that acted more like a compression shirt not an &#34;dry fit&#34; undershirt."
8442,1,B09M6X79V9,0,The are huge Way to big
8443,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Don‚Äôt waste your money Caution ladies!! They are not true to size!! I ordered a size up and they are like crop tops. They are definitely NOT compression tops!!
8444,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Its Okay. I'd rather that it didn't have the Lettering on the shirt.
8445,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Spandex-bad for tummy rolls These are thin and stretchy like spandex. I think these would have been good if I had sized WAY up. I am 5'5 and 150lbs and chose a medium based on reviews. The spandex excentuates any tummy flab. If my belly was flat, these would be amazing."
8446,1,B09M6X79V9,0,A disappointing buy! No compression at all! Also too short!
8447,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Large Chested 5'8 180, picked medium and still didn't fit. I usually pick a large sweater, or sweatshirt all the time because I have a very athletic frame. I'm 5'8 180 and very stocky up top but I said, oh well I will try the medium because people are saying it runs big. Well, it is still big and under the armpits has way too much sweater. the pictures do no justice with their arms down to the side, very misleading.<br /><br />You get what you paid for. spend a few extra bucks and also go to the store, because you can never tell how something fits you by looking at pictures."
8448,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Runs small!!! This reminded me of ordering off of wish! It was about 2 too small!
8449,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Material is cheap Design on material is nice but Material is cheap
8450,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Soft fabric- too big at bottom of shirt Loved open shoulders, back and length of shirt. For me, the bottom of shirt was cut too wide and I decided to return the shirt.. If it‚Äôs helpful- I ordered a medium; am 5‚Äô10‚Äù; 135 lbs; 34A."
8451,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Sizing off I have these in Large and XL. On the large the waistband is really tight so i bought an XL, which fits better in waist but the rest is too big, the XL is also shorter. Do not like the second pair i bought."
8452,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Horrible For Actual Exercise The tank top fit horribly. It hangs low in the front and gets lower the minute you exercise, all the while the back starts to ride up and by the time you are half way through a set your choking from the back while exposing your manly cleavage."
8453,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"nice material, but poor sowing The material itself is very nice! Stretchy and not too thick or thin. BUT, after one wear the inner seams started unraveling and there's already a hole that I'll have to sow up. I wasn't doing any intense workout either, so that was a bit disappointing. If I didn't have to worry about that seam issue I'd buy more pairs, but not if they were all sown together weakly"
8454,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Does not run bigger I have own this sweater for less than a month and the pocket is already separating from the sweater...also, this does not run big like other reviews stated. It is a warm sweater and i do like that part. Yes, i am female and i bought a male sweater."
8455,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,The shirts look cool and stylish but they started tearing after one day ... The shirts look cool and stylish but they started tearing after one day of use. They are one time use.
8456,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,same brand when shop but when delivered not same brand nit same fabric not same style i did purchased two different size with this seller or brand  small and medium but when received not same fabric  and the size medium is smaller /more tight than small size. its not the same. very disappointed .
8457,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Just ok. Nothing special and doesn‚Äôt fit great but the price is really good.
8458,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Im 5""11 230 I would usually were a XL in ... Im 5&#34;11 230 I would usually were a XL in tanks but from other reviews they say go down a size for it not to be lose. It Fits well the material feels weird on my skin and will take some getting used to. Thery are very short so it rides up when tucked."
8459,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Holy cameltoe The material is very soft and stretchy. Waist band is perfect. 2 stars because the crotch design bunches up and creates a massive cameltoe that ruins the leggings indefinitely. Will be returning for a refund.
8460,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Ok but not very soft If you're looking for comfy and soft sweats try the Bebe brand.  These are just not nearly as comfortable.
8461,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,not that good Moisture wicking is what your looking for don't buy this
8462,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Just ok. Just meh...not much compression at all. I like to feel my tummy snuggly held in, but still be able to breath. These don‚Äôt really do that. I‚Äôm sure the lines on the butt are flattering for someone with a round rear...I‚Äôm not that person so it looks odd on my flat behind! The pass the squat test, but just meh."
8463,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Really shoddy, doesn't look like a new product I received this pair of sweatpants today. Firstly, for anyone who cares about this sort of thing, it's not Polo Ralph Lauren - they state it explicitly on the tag. (Although it's worth noting that they neglected to mention that on the actual Amazon listing for the product.)<br /><br />Secondly, they're extremely shoddily made. Very thin material. They look like they're pilling everywhere, although it's difficult to tell if they are in fact pilling due to the ""pattern"" of the material. They're also very scratchy.<br /><br />Thirdly, when I tried them on I didn't get the impression that they're actually new, which is a very unpleasant sensation.<br /><br />Do *not* purchase if you're looking for warm, cozy sweatpants. These are not them."
8464,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"For flat-chested figures only :( Too small to put on so I can't say anything much about it. If you are over an A cup, this won't work for you."
8465,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Thin material They were ok I suppose for lounging. But definitely not for the Gym. Very thin. And definitely not squat proof.
8466,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Green tank was actually yellow The green tank is actually more yellow and I wanted it to be green like the picture!
8467,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Nice dress. Too thin of material. I loved this dress; however it was so thin that I could not wear it. It fits nice and is true to size, but just incredibly thin material."
8468,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Dirty not new with food stains The sweater was use not new it had food stains.I was upset but my son did not wanted to send it back . We washed.
8469,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Returning item defected One of pockets were sewed shut
8470,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not a neon pink Was excited to get the pink shown in the listing. What I received is nowhere close.
8471,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Sleeves are shorter Bought the Small size, fits well except for the sleeves which are short by an inch. Hence can‚Äôt use it for running outdoors in cold winter. Good price for a pack of three and good material."
8472,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Short and ride up Material is great and is very soft and breathable but the tanks are very short and ride up
8473,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Slippery textured shirts I ordered these men shirts for me, definitely shld HV ordered smaller size, shirts were too large for me. Also, didn't like silky polyester texture.  Was hoping for cotton. I shld HV read description thoroughly so overall probably my mistake but they were inexpensive so no biggie. Gonna wash and put in dryer to shrink"
8474,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Comfy, but more silky than soft These are great pants.  I love them for around the house.  I like the wide waistband, it doesn't have a lot of seaming so it's not itchy.  They are 3/4 length and have deep enough pockets for your phone.  The pants are more of a silky material rather than a cozy soft material like other joggers.  That's really my only complaint.  So yes, they are soft, but not the buttersoft fabric I was expecting."
8475,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Not worth it I usually wear an XL but when I ordered an XL it was too large. I bought 3 hoodies. (Red, green, and pink)  Because the hoodies were too large I had to return them. The shipping was expensive and I was not happy about that.  I will never buy these hoodies again."
8476,2,B097RFTKJP,0,I gave it away...lol I don't like the material
8477,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Too small.  Poor quality Toooooooooo small, returned"
8478,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Hollow in the cardigan / This will be Christmas gift but seems to be too small and it has a hole.
8479,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Size is Misleading Too small - will return. The material is flimsy
8480,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Not the color showed in picture at all Ordered this to go with a pair of sneakers and it didn‚Äôt match the neon pink at all was more of a light pink
8481,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Sheer Looked sheer and not comfortable
8482,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars I thought it was going to be a little more dressy. It's an oversized sweatshirt
8483,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not a compression shirt, does not help with shaping I read many of the bad reviews and chose to give it a try anyway. Very disappointed. These are basically tight vests. They don't help with shaping."
8484,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Terrible design Dress us very flimsy- and fit is 2 to 3 sizes too small
8485,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Wrinkles Easily This dress is Okay. Wrinkles easy and I don‚Äôt iron.<br />Thought about returning but decided to keep it and use it for lounge wear.
8486,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Will not buy again horrible quality
8487,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"super big tank tops and i got mediums Not what i thought, super big tank tops and i got mediums. Im 180lbs so a medium should be tighter not loose. Material was super cheap and spandexy."
8488,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Irregular Cooked fit Shirts fit like they are irregular they don't sit correctly they fit crooked not comfortable
8489,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Large Too large and longer than I thought<br />The hole is very  big
8490,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Ripped cheap shirt This is a really cheap shirt. Feels like an old hanes t that some one cut the holes out of. Mine was ripped in the arm pit area before I even wore it. Would not recommend!!!
8491,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Huge This sweatshirte is huge.  I have many in this size, and they fit well.  This is more like a XXXL"
8492,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Fabric is very rough but not comfortable What color is pretty and the Heather blue but the fabric is very rough and not a soft material to wear. It also looks like it would put a lot of fabric pills on it after being washed just by the type of fabric it is
8493,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Too long. Doesn‚Äôt fit like black and white dress Too long. I bought this second one as I like the black and white dress‚Äîdifferent fit. Way too long.
8494,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars I love it but it didn‚Äôt fit as expected
8495,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Order at least 2 sizes up My size is XXL but I ordered 2X because I saw mentions in the reviews that they run small, but still, it was as if I ordered a medium. Super tight and uncomfortable. Also, the fabric was not soft and looked as if someone wore it before. I ordered two different colors and had to return them both."
8496,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Bad Quality Flimsy
8497,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Good hoodie but color is way off It‚Äôs a good hoodie, BUT the color is nothing like the picture. I was so disappointed since I was so excited for it to come. I specifically ordered it to match a pair of shoes. The color on the picture would have matched perfectly, but when the actual item arrived the color was nothing like the picture, so I felt like I just wasted money honestly.."
8498,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Uncomfortable tag in front This dress would be great but the tag is sewn in the front instead of the back. I cut it out but it‚Äôs still itchy.
8499,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars hood part is small everything else is ok nothing too exceptional. thin
8500,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,It's not true to size will never order this item again I didn't like the item it doesn't fit.  I ordered a big enough size and it still didn't fit.
8501,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Seam began unraveling after less than an hr. of wear. I had to return this due to a defect in the shoulder seam, as well as it being a good deal larger than my previous sweater also a russell medium,  as with all amazon purchases there was no hassle with the return/exchange and hope i can give a better review when i receive this in a small."
8502,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Sleeves too short! The sleeves were way too short.  And, the stomach area was at least a size too big for a medium.  The rest fit loosely, but ok.  The material seemed warm and still lightweight.  The short sleeves were a deal-breaker and I returned it."
8503,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars The sleeves are much too large.
8504,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,no thanks This shirt is partially transparent and its too long. When I tried on the white one and looked in the mirror I could see through it well enough to tell the color of my underear. I could almost read &#34;Nautica&#34; on the waistband. Dont waste your money.
8505,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Definitely not sweat proof I bought the Marine blue marl in size small (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and 145lbs) the fit was PERFECT and super flattering HOWEVER The sweat was super noticeable! I was really disappointed because i thought i finally found a good pair that would hide the sweat, especially because i had read an earlier review that said the marine blue marl was recommended by the company for this specific reason. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed. I guess I‚Äôll only wear them for lighter workouts‚Ä¶"
8506,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"TIGHT ACROSS THE CHEST AREA The chest area is VERY SMALL. Everything else about this dress is great, but unfortunately it is not made for busty women."
8507,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Short torso If you are average to above average in height this not the top for you. Also, I made the mistake of washing the tops. Let hang dry and used cold water but they still shrunk even more."
8508,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Beautiful and light! üëç Cool and comfy. Very summery look and feel. Flattering. I love it! Recommended
8509,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Dont waste your money Rides up and turns into a belly shirt...very disappointed
8510,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Was not happy the size was too large.  Also the quality of the fabric was not supportive enough, cheap material used.  Also, they mixed up the sizes of what I ordered.  Sadly, I had to return this item.  I liked the style of the item and I am still on the look out for a better quality fabric tank top that resembles this one."
8511,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"way to big in front I can alter and cut the fabric to make it fit better. Some might like the big gaping fabric in front, not me."

8513,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Not what I wanted I orded a 4X in blue (I like it oversized) and I got a XL in green - still fits, but I wish I got the right thing that I ordered."

8515,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Not my jam‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and about 145. I‚Äôm usually a solid medium in pants (6/8 in jeans), but if I want a baggier fit I can go for a large. I ordered both. The medium fits like yoga pants. The large fits like I would expect. Be warned, lighter colors show every bump and imperfection. The dark olive color is brown. The length was fine on both sizes. They are very stretchy, so maybe that part is true to size. They may be a tad thicker than leggings. These are just not for me."
8516,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Thin material, cheaply made. The dress material was extremely thin and see threw , returned."
8517,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Worst product ever. Tears with one use.
8518,1,B09M6X79V9,0,This tank top rides up! I wanted long tanks to wear under other shirts on and off the bike. These are not long enough nor do they stay put. I would not recommend.
8519,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Stinks I really like the fit of this dress however it is really perfumed. I need to wash before wearing and hope the smell comes out.
8520,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Two Stars Only one fit well the other 2 felt like cheaper cloth and fit loose
8521,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression Not compression at all. Loose fitting, silky textured material. I still use them to work out but if you're looking for something compression wise- buy something else. Bought a medium but could've bought a small."
8522,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"A very large XL This sweat could have been for the Big and Tall shop it was so large.  I will wash in hot water and see if it shrinks any.  If not, I will donate it."
8523,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Way too large Size much larger than expected and returned
8524,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not squat proof! They fit great and look great but are definitely not leg day worthy. You can read the tag through the pants when I squat lol
8525,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs VERY small... order 1-2 sizes up The tank tops are fine and seem like decent quality but they run so small. I wish I would‚Äôve ordered XL when I‚Äôm typically a L. They will prob end up collecting dust in my wardrobe
8526,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not a Compression Tank No support and definitely NOT a compression tank.
8527,1,B009R09Z8W,0,The hoodie feels great. The stitching is coming apart. The hoodie will not last more then a month This hoodie is falling apart. The stitching is poor. Great material/ soft and lightweight but if stitching is coming apart It doesn't matter.
8528,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Comfortable Not much spandex to this compression too
8529,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Brought them too big. I should have brought them in a smaller size so they would support me better.
8530,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"I would never order these shirts again, I wish I had read the reviews. The material was terrible, the shirts fit weird, the seems are all messed up."
8531,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Nah.. Very cute and pretty dress, but after the 1st wash I found a hole.... I wish for the price I paid it was better quality."
8532,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Confusing straps When I first opened the package I thought it was defective because of the strapping. Only one side has a strap and the other side has two loose ends. Would prefer straps on both sides. I just tie a small knot in the front to connect the loose ends and then tuck them away inside my bra.
8533,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Good Quality for the money A little larger then expected but over all good quality.  Not bad for the money. I would recommend to anyone.
8534,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Misleading picture Not at all as picture shows. Picture shows long , yet dress I recieved has a short front long back and the front has a v cut on the bottom. Sides have a v cut on each side . NOT same dress on Amazon picture . Do disappointing"
8535,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"It's ok It's a very cute print; but exactly that. The material is thin and kind of a cheap look to it. It's fine and comfortable for casual wear, but would not be my choice for anything nicer than that. It does fit well and the print helps provide an hourglass look for those of us who do not have much curve."
8536,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Pilling badly! I have bought 2 pairs from this brand before and was super happy with the quality and durability! Recently I got another pair, and after just ONE wash it was pilling badly! (See photos) Don‚Äôt know if their quality went down, or if I did anything wrong?? :("
8537,3,B09M6X79V9,0,These are for layering. You need a bra with them. Very thin material. I was expecting the tops to be more supportive and there is no support. 36D
8538,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Sizing inaccurate Fun colors but sizing not reliable.  Of the three, they ran very small to small."
8539,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Love it! Love it! Definitely one of my new favorites.
8540,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Bummer Too small and short.
8541,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Just a regular tank top These are supposed to be compression type shirts but what I received was something that resembled a regular tank top. They don‚Äôt compress at all and the threads were coming undone right out of the package. The fit is larger than what I ordered and as for customer service...forget it. Do yourself a favor an stray away from these.

8548,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,It feels weird Not something I would want to wear to the gym
8549,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Nowhere on the packaging does it say compression bra\tank They are just too big.  I purchased a medium, per my doctor.  I returned them.  I did not think the elastic was anything near compression.  If they don't fit it's a waste of money.  This product is just not worth the money.  I buy one medium bra & its too small, then buy these & they're too big.  Who comes up with these sizes?"
8550,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars It's very pretty but ran small in the bust. Had to send it back. üòû
8551,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Just lil small Gave it to the kids lil small on me
8552,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Reminded me of jeans from the 90's... No room for the Booty I gave this 2 stars because of the way they fit and the seam opened in the back resulting in a hole after wearing them twice. These pants are for flat booties only. The way they are sewn doesn't give any room for an average size bottom. They are a lightweight sweatpant which I liked but the fit was weird.
8553,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not at all Gymshark dupes like many reviews state I will say that these are more stretchy than gymshark leggings but they have weird extra material in the crotch area. They‚Äôre not sweat wicking so I would wear these on an arm day or just for lounging in. They are cute though!
8554,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Not true to size Should have listened to reviews. I typically wear a medium or 8. This shirt runs very small. I would say if I bought this shirt in the store the medium would fit like an x-small or even small. I will re-order and size up either one size or two sizes up. I rarely take a large in anything much less an extra large however, with this shirt if you normally wear a medium then buy either large or better yet an extra large. Also, the material is polyester and spandex. I would not classify it as a compression shirt as advertised. The material is quite thin. Therefore, if you are wanting a shirt to ""hold you in"" this is not the shirt. I ordered red, black and white and like the colors."
8555,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Spandex For a tight undershirt for work they're fine, but not compression, tight spandex only as a undershirt ok"

Overall, I like the simplicity of the dress. I wear a Med but ordered large to be sure it was long enough.  This dress still lays above ankle."
8558,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Regret I regret buying this hoodie because it does not seem to deflect cold wind. It fit as expected but the material on the inside is not soft so it loses another star for comfortability.

8561,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Wierd fit Purchased several in different colors same size. They all fit different. Some tight in the chest some not, some loose in the arms and others too tight. Some longer and some shorter. None are consistently cut. They're certainly not the Russells of a few years ago."
8562,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Fit weird This pair fit very awkwardly. Someone was in a hurry to finish sewing. It feels as though the front and back pieces were reversed in the sewing process.

8566,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Different sizes are different fabric I ordered this in 2 sizes for my wife. The dresses were 2 different fabrics.!? The smaller size was a great quality material, smooth and soft with a perfect amount of stretch but was a little to tight. No problem. The larger size should be just right. Nope! Less stretch, cheap screen printed pattern that showed the white base through the print as it stretched, rougher texture. Had to return both. If the larger size had been the better quality fabric, this would have looked spectacular on her. I'm sad."

8573,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Plus size ladies....not for us! I am 5'4"", 225 llbs and purchased an XL because that's the largest size they have. Material on the legs is super stretchy...really liked it, but the waistband is awful. It's much tighter than the rest of the leggings, emphasizes my lower belly area terribly, rolls down and just has way too much compression. It's disproportionate from the rest of the leggings.<br /><br />If you have a relatively flat stomach or just a slight pooch, these would be great, but if you carry weight in your mid section, avoid them."

8578,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Good quality but thin These were too thin so I returned them. If you are looking for that then this would be perfect for you. Personally I was looking for something thicker
8579,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Too low cut. Too low cut/rise to be comfortable. Was not included in description.
8580,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Somewhat disappointed in this purchase The tail on the jacket is shorter than indicated in the picture.  It only covers slightly below the hip area.  Somewhat  disappointed in this purchase.

The rest of it fits fine as it's made to be flowing but I couldn't squeeze my boobs into this dress and had to have it altered. Very disappointed.
8593,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Grande Muy grande
8594,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Too short Shouldn‚Äôt be labeled as tall. Big maybe but not tall. Ordered as a gift for someone needing. 5xl Tall! Sleeves too short and length hit right at the top of pants.

8600,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"See through :( I absolutely loved everything about these leggings- perfect fit, stretch, color. Unfortunately they are so see through I could see my tattoos through the fabric! Someone without tattoos could probably get away with wearing these but definitely would not pass the squat test."
8601,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Buyer beware Poor Quality Tore at the seam after the first wash.  Poor quality, not worth the money.  The poor quality tank tops run a little small too."

8603,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Does not look like the picture.  Is much shorter than shown Shorter than appeared and color is off. Looks to be maroon but came in more pink
8604,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not sweat proof I wore these to the gym recently and had a pretty heavy workout. These leggings showed every sweat droplet which was embarrassing. If I could return these leggings I would!
8605,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Go up a size! Ordered a large and they fit more like a medium.
8606,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Felt like a knockoff Ink was not any where near as full as others. Felt like a knockoff.
8607,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Nice material, size up For reference: I am 5'2"", 117 pounds, with long legs and a short torso. Athletic build (narrow hips, bigger thighs). I bought these leggings in grey size XS and marled blue size S. The grey size XS fits me and has good compression which I like, but they are too short on me, and the line that is supposed to go under your butt goes like halfway up my butt, and my butt is not that big. The blue size S is the right length and fits much better. However, the waistband is just a smidge looser than I would like. Overall, not bad for the price though, and I love the material. They are also not sweatproof, but that does not bother me that much. I would buy more colors in the size Small for sure."
8608,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Waste of money Doesn‚Äôt compress anything!
8609,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Be careful - ordered twice and second order was not the same product as the first. I have ordered the same size of this product in the past 3 months and the fit was much tighter. I'm the same size now as i was when i first ordered 3 months back, but yet the shipment i received a few weeks ago is not fitting like the first order.  The tags look different altogether. I don't think the second shipment i received was the same make,  this product seems to vary in size based on the material used."
8610,3,B0B16Q1854,0,The item was what I expected The pants are very comfortable easy fit nice to wear in or out side.
8611,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,... but i guess in winter with sweaters would be good i live in little larger  than im  thought  but  i  guess  in  winter  with  sweaters  would  be  good  i live  in  fl
8612,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not really breathable It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs just that It‚Äôll cook you if you wear it underneath something... gets extremely hot"
8613,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Needs a little more support Not as much support as I expected, material is very flexible."
8614,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Thin material and runs small Material is paper thin and dress runs small.
8615,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Disappointed not compression I was anxiously waiting for these to be delivered so I could try them on and I ended up being a bit disappointed bc there's nothing compression about them they are basically just the wicked dry fit material.
8616,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Damaged goods The shirt itself is great but 1 can sliced across the mid section. I tried to reach out for a replacement but cannot get ahold of the seller. Disappointed!
8617,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Size misrepresented I absolutely LOVE the colors, the material and the design. However, for most of my life, I have worn size Medium, so in order to have some lose roominess I ordered these T-Shirts in the X-Large size. But the X-Large size fits super snug to the point of being uncomfortably tight. TOO SMALL! There is NO roominess or breathing room."
8618,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Faded after 1 wash Beautiful dress but the colors faded and fuzzy after the first wash.
8619,3,B09M6X79V9,0,They roll up The shirts roll up under my overalls.
8620,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not a shaping under shirt! Know this in advance. Very soft material, extremely comfortable, just like spandex. It‚Äôs nice and feed it, but if you don‚Äôt have already a nice body this will not help you shape or retain the love handles or the belly. It‚Äôs more like her favorite shirt nor a shaping shirt."
8621,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Okay. Doesn‚Äôt compress much.
8622,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Nah I look like Barbie meets MC Hammer.
8623,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Runs small It ran on small side and I am 5‚Äô2 and it was a little short.
8624,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Good for a month. I loved it, for the first month.<br />After few times in the Laundry it shrunk :( and I didn‚Äôt even dry in the dryer, just hanging to dry.<br />Now it‚Äôs just looking strange.  Also the quality is not as good...<br /><br />Disappointed.<br /><br />Too bad, it looked great when I got it."
8625,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Seam down the front of the dress should be on the back This dress had a seam right down the FRONT of it where it should‚Äôve been on the back of the dress. The fabric didn‚Äôt match up along the seam and looks awful. I definitely would not recommend it this dress to anyone until it‚Äôs made correctly.
8626,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Misinformation This item was way to small, therefore, I could not put it on.  Order was for XL. This product wouldn't fit a 7/8 size."
8627,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star The neckline of the tank tops fall apart after a short period of time.
8628,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Average product Definitely run small. I ordered a Large which is what i wear in everything else. I'm 6' and 190 lbs, fairly fit and these fit very small. Kind of a weird mess-jersey material."
8629,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Two Stars Poor quality, and the back is a lot shorter then the front."

8632,2,B07XD71F1H,0,To big Way to big . I am an xl should of ordered a large.
8633,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not safety orange These were more like bright tangerine. Not what we expected.
8634,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"mine was short, mine was short, but i ordered one size smaller due to reviews saying runs big which it did just not long enough"
8635,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,A little too big I just would have went a size smaller if I knew that‚Äôs how they fit
8636,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Poor quality Loved the dress but it came faded and with the color missing in places
8637,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars pretty but size is waaay too off for me
8638,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Fit good, but one shirt was used. One of the shirts smelled like sweat, real bad."
8639,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Too thin. No warmth at all Very thin. I was looking for something a little warmer at least. I ordered a 3XL I'm probably a XL in these I did want them baggy cuz my legs are 6x their normal size so since they're so swollen I figured bigger would be better but these are too big. But next time now I'll know to order smaller but to be honest these are soooooo thin I dont understand why they cost so much
8640,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Returned them Tight & scratchy
8641,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Fabric pills and looks terrible after washing I washed this item in cold water and hung to dry. After only one wash the fabric was pilling and looked worn. I wanted to return but apparently had missed the window to return. I am guessing the item was defective.
8642,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not like the older sweat shirts A little thin,  Not like the older sweat shirts."
8643,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression Not compression but nice thick material.
8644,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Two Stars Nice material, but not long enough. I am 5'9&#34; and they are too short. Had to return."
8645,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"sad I was so happy when this dress arrived it looked just like the picture and the material was light and fresh as I had hoped.  The adjustable straps really got me as i'm short and have a hard time finding long dresses i wont step on.  I loved this dress until I slipped it on and noticed a big gaping whole down the center seem right in between my chest.  looks like a bad sewing job.  I was considering sewing the dress, but the whole has started to fray....so disappointed."
8646,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not soft at all Very rough feel. I know it was inexpensive and wasn't expecting something out of this world but it feels cheap and not soft at all as one would expect for something described as fleece. For the price there are many other options I suggest trying one of those instead.
8647,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Cheaply made Poor quality
8648,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"ordered the wrong color it fit just fine but i thought the color was going to be darker, so i had to return it."
8649,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,If you have Sensitive nipples you won't like the material. I liked how they fit but the material is a real nipple rubber.
8650,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Nice but arm holes are stretched out?? Nice but arm holes are stretched so ...
8651,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Just ok The seams don't match up. I am pretty sure they are ones they don't sell in stores other than Marshalls, TJ Maxx, or Burlington."
8652,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"These are NOT cotton These are not fleece sweat pants, and there is no cotton in the weird, scratchy material. I think it may be all polyester. They look like an old t-shirt. Mine came dirty with the tag pinned on so someone else must have worn them then sent them back."
8653,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not long enough for me I wish they would have been longer.  Wouldn‚Äôt purchase again.
8654,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Short in back Cute shirt, very soft.  Really thin so its not to keep warm.  But it is really short in the back and looks awkward so I am returning."
8655,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"You can do better This product just has a weird cut.  Body on size med cut on the smaller size width-wise, but arms are big (not long, but big like lots of extra fabric in the upper arms).  Size large body was huge and arms weren't that much bigger.... just didn't work for us.  Med body was also borderline on the short side - so it would be ok if it didn't shrink a bit, but we all know a moderate amount of shrinkage is to be expected particularly in the length.  Side note: quality seems 'ok'.  Lots of loose threads that would make me think twice about keeping even if I could get a size that worked for my husband."
8656,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Never again. This product was not what I expected at all. The material was cheap and itchy and the color was off then what was advertised. I purchased a white tank top that came to me appearing stained blue. Would not buy from this company again.
8657,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Runs small This sweatshirt is probably not American sized. It‚Äôs way smaller than a russel athletics official collegiate hoodie that I just ordered from Amazon. After washing this hoodie, it shrank. My son is 6‚Äô, 210lbs and fits the russel athletic xl hoodie perfectly, but this shirt is more like a women‚Äôs large.  Also the printed logo is faint and anything but vibrant. Looks worn already. Gave it three stars only because it now fits me, not my son."
8658,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Disappointment I like that they feel lightweight? However, the sizing is out of whack and they feel cheap for the price I paid, even for it being on sale. I bought an XS. I'm a relatively built and short guy, and I received no support or ""compression"" from these tank tops whatsoever. It was still baggy and ill-fitted. They're paper-thin even without having to stretch much. I definitely wouldn't recommend these, especially if you're on the smaller side, or have remotely mild gynecomastia, or are transgender. I can't imagine fabric this thin doing anybody wonders, to be honest, even for someone taller and larger than me, etc."
8659,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Ok literally I opened the package and was so disappointed. These are incredibly cheap and thin fabric Ok literally I opened the package and was so disappointed. These are incredibly cheap and thin fabric, and not at all what I anticipated. I thought these would be soft and feel more like cotton so they could be more &#34;athleisure&#34; status. I dont think they are cute enough to wear out and about, but honestly felt too embarrassed to wear them to the gym either. That's why I immediately sent them back."
8660,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Two Stars Not really liking the material, but I‚Äôll give it a try"
8661,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Too Big! I ordered a medium but when it came in it is way too big to fit. Fits like a large. Disappointed after waiting so long for the product it didn't work out the way I thought it would.
8662,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not what‚Äôs advertised. Product is advertised 15% spandex. It‚Äôs only ten. Does not provide support I was looking for. Due to lymphedema therapist said to get 15% so I ordered these. Very little support. Not what I expected.
8663,3,B0B16Q1854,0,love these but having return a 2nd time due to damage 2nd time having to return due to damage
8664,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Shrinks The first time I wore them they fitted great. After I started wearing them they stretched out on the stomach area and got extremely tight in the crotch area.
8665,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Way too small There is NO WAY this is an extra large. This was a small.
8666,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not even sewn together correctly. Poorly made, one of the two pockets is even sewn in backwards, so the seam is weird and the pocket hangs up rather than down. It feels like I'm wearing something put together by someone learning how to sew. The fabric is cute. But man, this thing will fall apart after one washing, which is a bummer because I was hoping for a lightweight simple breezy dress."
8667,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Good value, bad sizing, bad order picking I ordered XL based on the size chart expecting it to still be tight. I usually wear a medium in tops. They are loose, but could work for certain purposes. However, one of three long sleeve shirts is a short sleeve T-shirt and is gigantic. I will be returning. Good for the price if you get what is ordered and pick the right size."
8668,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Best alternative to the magic GAP sweatshirts of the mid-90s GAP used to make the perfect sweatshirt in the 90's of this style - the inside wasn't 'fluffy soft' like this, but thinner - not exactly fleece.<br /><br />This is traditional fleece, which just doesn't hang as well or look as good, a bit staticy when removed, but its the closest I can find to the magically GAP sweatshirts of the 90's."
8669,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,It's great from the front but barely hits my butt in ... After reading reviews I dhave coded to buy the biggest size in hopes it would be long and flowy. It's great from the front but barely hits my butt in the back. Still super cute and fits fine just wish it was longer. Btw I'm 5'11 so I rarely have luck lol
8670,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Nope This is a terrible fit! Got it for my fianc√© to replace his current crew neck pullover and it didn't work at all. Sleeves were really long and bunched up. I'll-fitting, unflattering."
8671,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Aweful. I had high hopes for this dress and I was terribly disappointed. It looks like a table cloth that was poorly transformed into a dress. The seam goes straight down the front. Don't waste your time on this one.
8672,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Thinner and shorter than it appears It's pretty but not as long as it appears in the picture
8673,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"So small! Cute, but way too small."
8674,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star I made request for XXL but I received XXXL
8675,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Size Matters I wear a medium normally.  I ordered mediums after reviewing the size chart.  They were so tight I could hardly get the tank top on.  This was amazon fulfilled so I was able to request a refund and drop off at my nearest UPS store.  The refund was issues fairly quickly after, it is the best way to go in my opinion.  I had to order Extra Large for the tank top to fit, and it is very tight fitting still, but wearable.  If you are going to purchase this item, be sure to order 2 sizes up for a form fitting look.  I would have had to order a 2XL in order to have some flow of the garment."
8676,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,sizing different than other colors I bought these leggings in this pink color as well as grey and black. The pink leggings were noticeably longer when compared to the other colors. They were extremely high waisted to the point it was not flattering. Love the leggings other than that!
8677,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Good fit, but not good cut The fit is fine, but I don't like the cut. I like more of a scoop hem, thinner shoulder straps, lower arm openings to allow for lats,"
8678,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"White shirt was damaged When received my item was very excited. The fit was true to size. The black and red shirts were fine but noted the red shirt dye damaged the white. I washed it thinking it would go away, it actually damaged the white shirt.  This was upsetting because the shirts are good quality and very durable. My daughter uses them for lacrosse."
8679,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Not color advertised The quality is great! I have washed it several times and it still looks new and feels soft. The color is not the same advertised.
8680,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not as good as the short sleve. The material is almost completely different from their short sleeve shirts. And the size fits smaller as well. I bought the short sleeve vneck and crew shirts and I think they're great but the long sleeve feels cheaper and runs smaller. Not certain how that works?
8681,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Don‚Äôt buy After 1st wear the metal ring that holds the draw string came off, drawstring won‚Äôt stay in."
8682,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not a compression tank top I gave it three stars because I do like the tank top and how long it is, however there is no compression whatsoever."
8683,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not the same product Not the same dress as shown. Totally different design!
8684,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not for compression or working out! Super thin! These are not for shaping/compression  or working out in! It‚Äôs super thin material and you can see through. It reminds me of a thin sleep shirt which is what I‚Äôll be using them for
8685,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Bodily fluid stain on one of them Came with a white stain on it looks like its either a dried up boogers or some other dried up crusty  bodily fluid. absolutely disgusting. Will be returning and will not order again
8686,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Two Stars NOT compression (even when sizing down). Thin material. Wish they were longer length
8687,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Disappointing - the quality has diminished I‚Äôve loved and worn this brand for years. I‚Äôm disappointed in the sizing of my current purchases but I‚Äôm especially disappointed regarding the pilling that has already spread from the arms to the chest and back. I‚Äôll keep them but didn‚Äôt expect to have mow these with a fabric shaver less than three weeks from purchase date.
8688,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Rolled down So maybe you can only wear these high waisted  leggings if you are thin without them rolling down, but as soon as I bent over they just rolled down.  I am a size 12/Large and purchased a large. The quality seemed really great and they were very nice but they just were  uncomfortable since they rolled down; I just ordered some others from a different brand that are also high waist so I will see .."
8689,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Fit was fine, but But the material pilled up after several washing. This is true for both the Russell tops and the bottom. A seam on the bottoms opened soon after buying. Old adage, buy cheap and get cheap."
8690,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Stain on white shirt The shirts were great until I noticed the red stain on the white shirt.
8691,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Is as expected Sweater isn‚Äôt bad but the problem with many xxx large sweaters is the neck collars are huge most people, even over weight people, don‚Äôt have 32‚Äù necks. Common problem among big people and not limited to any specific brand. I recommend getting measurements done if your someone over weight or don‚Äôt fit a traditional size."
8692,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Meh... The material was not soft. It feels like a very low quality product. I returned it.
8693,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Wouldn't buy again but arrived quickly
8694,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cute, but no compression These tanks are super cute, and I love the light weight material. Colors are also very bright. I purchased the BK/Bl/PNK. I was very tempted to keep them. However, I really need tanks with some ""shape"" control. These tanks have no compression at all. I even purchased a smaller size.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice silky feeling tank... You will not go wrong with these."
8695,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Fair quality The fabric began to &#34;pill&#34; (form tiny fuz balls) quickly.  I only washed it in cold water :-( It is comfy.
8696,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Pills and looks terrible Upon the first wash this shirt pilled up and looks absolutely terrible.
8697,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Sizing sucks-be prepared to return Sizing is so screwed up. I ordered XL, and they sent a L. Those fit ok, I just like mine looser. Traded for an XL, those arrived and are even smaller than the L. Not worth the hassle of returning and trying again. Don‚Äôt reccomend"
8698,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,Great shirt but run big! These shirts I think run about 2 sizes too big. I prefer a slightly more tailored fit and found that I could order 2 sizes smaller. Overall great shirt.
8699,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,not a good fit was not long enough and could have been softer
8700,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very small not true to adult size Way too small !!<br />I normally wear a 2X so I ordered a 3X just to be on the safe side.<br />What arrived was not adult sized, more like a junior size for a teen."
8701,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Small for size 3XL feels like an extra large not 1,2 or 3XL"
8702,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"You get what you pay for Perfect example of getting what you pay for here. The shirts have actual tags on the backs of the neck! Who does that these days? These tags, are the MOST bothersome things you will experience in your day to day operations. Removing said tags, is IMPOSSIBLE to do without destroying the ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù of the shirt. The shirts are also unexpectedly short. I ordered a 3X. I don‚Äôt typically wear a 3X, but I wanted an undershirt that was tall enough to stay tucked in. These aren‚Äôt available in the tall variety, so I ordered a size too big. Can‚Äôt wait to trash the other 2 after I wear them once"
8703,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No no no Ordered a 2Xl and they where to small
8704,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Don't waste your money Cheap material and cheaply made pattern. Not worth the money. Chinese quality (not a good thing)
8705,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Not what I thought iii The material was scratchy feeling very disappointed I've bought this brand not this item before so yes i returned it
8706,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Cute but not comfortable if you have a booty these pants are going to be uncomfortable, doesn't cover completely when sitting. The material does not feel like a soft comfortable sweat pants material"
8707,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Good hoodie price. Needed a sweatshirt with a hood and this fits pretty well and it's soft what else can I say.
8708,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"pocket ripped I had the hoodie for a week. And when I wore it out the pocket ripped  on the side, the stitching."
8709,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"i took the advise of other reviewers and ordered a size up and it fits nice, the fabric is not thick its ok, order a larger size, i took the advise of other reviewers and ordered a size up and it fits nice, the fabric is not thick."
8710,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,ZIPPER BROKE AFTER TWO WEARS!!! And I can't contact the seller and I can't return anymore.. Can anyone help me?
8711,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Boxy No curves not flattering. The others I bought from this supplier I loved this one not at all
8712,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not breathable, not for sensitive skin, very irritating material These shirts are not moisture wicking, they‚Äôre not breathable, they have very irritating material and they will cause breakouts if you have sensitive skin."
8713,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Wrong sizing. Very tight in arms and chest area. I will update my review if they send me a replacement or refund.
8714,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Looks ugly in person
8715,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Order larger size Sweatshirts shrunk so bad can no longer wear.
8716,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Poor material Material was a bit thin
8717,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Great fit Love the extra length of these tanks.  Received lots of compliments especial on the vibrant colors. Will probably buy more as you can never have enough.
8718,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small Run very small!!!
8719,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"tang tops fell apart they did not stay snug, and the stiches came off, please see photo"
8720,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Good hoodies but they run really big Good hoodies but they run really big, and if you try exchanging the hoodies,good luck because they never write back.(just go down one size)"
8721,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Thumbs down! Just bad all around...
8722,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not hot pink like pic. It‚Äôs a light neon pink Nice hoodie.
8723,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"It's just okay This is a fine t-shirt dress, but it's nothing special.  I ended up sending it back because I need more pieces in my wardrobe that are better than just okay."
8724,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not Rayon! This dress is made of polyester. Not good.
8725,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Size is not what is seems.... I ordered a large and it fit like a small on me. I normally wear a medium size but got a large since that is the size of my other sweatpants & they are more comfy when they are a bit looser. I really like the look of these but unsure if I will order again but if I do order again, I will be purchasing an x-large."
8726,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Dont... These are scratchy, uncomfortable and run very small. We ordered 5x and they are really about a 2x."
8727,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Smaller than expected Runs very very small
8728,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Two Stars And had a tear on one side of the pocket
8729,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Don‚Äôt be fooled There were only two in the package...
8730,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Damaged shirt Very disappointed as I got these for my daughter for basketball. Her school colors happened to be red, black, and white, so they seemed perfect for her!  My daughter has waited and needed these badly for basketball season. She took the white one to school today for athletics, puts it on and runs out to the court to realize the red shirt had faded on the white shirt. Very embarrassing. Unfortunately that‚Äôs all she had so she had to wear the shirt. She needs the black and red for weekend tournaments so unfortunately can‚Äôt exchange the damaged shirt Bc we need the other two! Very disappointed!"
8731,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Definitely should have got two sizes smaller Bought these as I love to wear camisoles and tanks under clothes. These came and they definitely were thin and larger than I expected. From other comments I expected this to run small but in fact it ran a bit bigger in my case. I'm rather tall as well and have a long torso so they could have been a bit longer as well.
8732,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cheap Appearance but fits to body shape. Colors are dull, not as shown on image.<br />Garment it self appears to have cheap finishing.<br />However, it fits right to size.<br />I rather spent a little more on branded tanks."
8733,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"Not worth the price. Started falling apart on 1sr wear.  Very cheaply made with very cheap material, also very thin material.  As far as size runs small.  Made in Honduras, it also came faded like the material had been over washed at some point in it's manufacturing."
8734,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Okay, but quality is questionable These workout shirts are just okay for the price, I guess.  I did notice that after the first wash, a couple of them showed signs of pilling.  Also, they don't breathe that well so if you do work up a sweat, it tends to stay on the shirts.  But just okay for the price."
8735,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Would fit a 12 year old<br />Bad customer service
8736,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not a compression fit. Advertized as a compression tank, however, nothing more than a stretch tank. Otherwise, likes that it stretched, goes over head and shoulders with easy.  I like the feel of compression, and this is not an embracing tight compression fit.  Maybe purchasing a small would give me a tighter, smaller fit?"
8737,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Way too small.. had to give it to ... Way too small.. had to give it to my daughter. I ordered a 3XL when I normally wear only a 2XL, the sweater was way too short and wouldn't close."
8738,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not what I expected Not what I expected.
8739,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Beware if you have thighs and ass. Normally, when I buy a large my pants are roomy. These pants gave my thighs a big nope. I got them to mid thigh before they became overwhelmed and refused to slide any further. I‚Äôm kind of bummed because it‚Äôs such a hassle to return things. So my daughter was just gifted a new pair of sweatpants."
8740,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"More like a legging instead of a jogger I was expecting a jogger, but these were tight like a legging."
8741,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Thin material and fit larger than expected Very thin. Decided to send it back because it also fit larger than I was hoping. Would make a better bathing suit cover up than dress.
8742,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Small and bad quality I usually love this brand but the sweatpants I ordered from here fit like a small 3x but I had a stain on my knee and the fabric seemed like it had holes in it. Like little teeny tiny holes like the fabric wasn't woven together enough. I will be sending back unfortunately.
8743,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,I was sent a $9.96 Fruit of the Loom sweatshirt instead of what I ordered. Not happy about it  
8744,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Hey As expected
8745,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Somehow I missed the huge logos I don't wear clothing with logos and/or writing on it. I don't know how the hell I missed it but this crap is covered in writing and logos.
8746,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Got these for after breast removal surgery and one was mis-sewed and too large The would have worked if we‚Äôre smaller. I ordered extra small.<br />Terrible sad job on one.
8747,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Runs Very SMALL I am usually an XL, I ordered this in a 4XL bc reviews said it runs 2 sizes small. The sleeves are very long, the cardigan length is not what the photo shows. It does not cover the back end. The material is okay, I'll have to see when its washed. Overall its cheap but doable."
8748,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not this size the chart told me I measured my chest like the chart told me and i got my size XL,,And the shirts are not tight at all. They have no compression"
8749,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Fits Small. I wanted to love this but it fits way to small.
8750,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Pretty nice Looks decent. I wear it all the time to the gym.
8751,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Great Pant, Short Life Span I love these workout pants! The material is very soft, stretch, and I do not have see through issues HOWEVER, every pair I‚Äôve owned, except one pair have ripped in either the middle of the butt or in the enter thigh. This makes me upset because they always tend to rip In the middle of a workout. I‚Äôve owned Nike pants that have lashes for many years. My purple pair ripped before I could get a good photo."
8752,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star rayon is a terrible fabric choice for this flowy-type dress
8753,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Very thin Thin and not supportive
8754,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not worth it! It was very unflattering. I ordered it in my size and it didn‚Äôt fit at all. Very cheap feeling! Feels and looks like something off of wish! DO NOT BUY!
8755,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Three Stars Thinner than I expected to be
8756,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Be careful how you wash Everything is great about the shirt until I washed it and now the fabric is basically peeling away/out and looks terrible after a few washes
8757,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Neleus Shirt Great shirt I expect dry fit to fit but be too tight. Definitely not true to size.
8758,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Would not recommend Runs very small, material is slick and does not stay tucked into jeans very well. Would not recommend this product"
8759,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,soft but runs small they run a little small. i am usually a size 8 and always wear a medium but the medium fit more like leggings that joggers. i would size up.
8760,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Some are short They‚Äôre good, but they‚Äôre all different lengths. The shortest significantly so."
8761,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Poor quality They fell apart and the stitching came out after 3 wears. I have 3 large holes in them making them unwearable
8762,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Comfort I thought I was getting blue on white but I got this crappy blue with pink letters.  So disappointed
8763,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Don't buy tear apart after one time wear I was excited to buy these but after wearing one time and washing them they fell apart big holes under the arm.i have a brand new front loader washer and dryer so that's not the problem its the naterial.i am so disappointed to spend the money on these when I never got to wear but once. Don't waste your money on these
8764,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Where's my muscles? I purchased this muscle tank thinking it would help me look like the guy in the picture.  I put it on and wore it around for 5 days straight without taking it off and guess what, I still don't have muscles.  I was going to return them but they are so comfortable I can't stop wearing them.  I like to wear them with jeans tucked in when hanging out with my lady friends or while I'm just relaxing on the couch binge watching Star Wars.  So if you looking to get ripped I would pass but if you want a great all around muscle tank, give it a shot..."
8765,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small Shirts ride up. They run small. I ordered a 3x when I normally wear a 2x.
8766,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,seems cheap Totally hated the texture of the material and how thin it was. Did not like the fit either.
8767,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too small Runs super small. Go a size up
8768,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too small They said they were an extra large but they are just way too tight so I sent them back
8769,2,B076QD9NP1,0,Low Quality Low quality printing on the fabric. There are parts where the printing was very flawed. I returned mine.
8770,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Just a tank No real compression.  Cute tank, though."
8771,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Ride up and smell weird They fit as expected. Were nice a tight for compression but they are pretty thin so not great for really cold weather and they ride up as I'm running, which is really aggravating. They also have an odd like chemical smell that I can't seem to get rid of even after washing."
8772,3,B009R09Z8W,0,medium quality I bought one pullover and one full zip hoodie for the money I expected better quality
8773,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Not consistent Cute and Warm pink. Grey pair same size, style, and brand do not fit. Can't leave the house to return or I would."
8774,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Runs big I had originally ordered a large but it was too baggy so I returned it then ordered a medium and it‚Äôs still baggy lol I came to the conclusion they run big lmbo!
8775,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Cheap fabric. Waste of money. Very. Cheap material. Arm holes very low. Need a shirt underneath this top
8776,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Great tanks for workout but not compression I‚Äôm giving these tank tops 3 stars because they do fit as expected however, I specifically ordered them because they were described as ‚Äúcompression‚Äù tank tops. They are not compression tanks at all. They are simply a thin poly/spandex blend. They are still great for working out but not exactly the type I was looking for."
8777,3,B097RFTKJP,0,nice but i dont like the material it could be nice but it is too loose and the matterial is weird
8778,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Didn't fit Xl was Asian size, wouldn't even fit my 16y/o son"

8781,1,B009R09Z8W,0,One Star It was way to small and to short
8782,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Little too big for a medium
8783,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Three Stars Too big  !
8784,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,What I ordered is not what I got I had ordered these before and loved them. So I ordered another pair.  I ordered Drawstring Charcoal but I got Black.  I went ahead and keep them and ordered another pair in drawstring Charcoal. We will see what I get.  üò¨
8785,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Dri Power Fleece Full-Zip Hoodie Well, I had to order a roomy sized hoodie for one of my sons away living six hours away at college. While our local Walmart and K-Mart had them of lesser quality, but lower priced, I didn't want to bother with packaging and mailing it myself, so I ordered through Amazon. Unfortunately, it was a third party sale, so no free shipping. It was nice enough, according to my son. I just had him home for Thanksgiving and was disappointed to find that the left front pocket is already ripping open at the top.  I didn't have time to sew it during this trip, and hope it doesn't worsen before he comes home for Christmas.  He's only had this hoodie for about two months now.  That part was disappointing. I think I would rather take my chances at the local Walmart or K-Mart next time he needs a hoodie. No shipping, and I could easily return a faulty item."
8786,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not worth it Fits right in all wrong spots. Too high at the neck and arms. Not comfortable. Makes me look sloppy. Going back.
8787,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"I like them ok They're regular. I like them ok. I wish they had more of a snug fit, though."
8788,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Medium fits like large/arms too bulky The medium sweatshirt is not a typical medium-it's totally oversized and fits like a large, plus the sleeves are too big/bulky."
8789,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Seam tearing horribly after first wash! Haven‚Äôt had them a month worn one time washed and the seam on the neckline is just unraveling entirely can‚Äôt get ahold of the seller so I figured I‚Äôd warn everyone! Bout them last year and they‚Äôve changed the material or something because this fabric is cheap and awful
8790,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Size Runs very small for size I can fit a 2x so I ordered a size up to be safe and it is way to small so I gave them to my niece who wears a women‚Äôs size medium and they fit perfectly on her
8791,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Completely see through I don‚Äôt know if it is just the color I got, but they are completely see through when I bend over. They are super cute, and really comfortable tho!"
8792,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Color I ordered what I thought was black and they are more of a navy blue than black, which is frustrating because I wanted them to be black not blue.  üôÑ"
8793,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Cheap material.... sent right back. ... Cheap material....sent right back. Should be expected for $12.
8794,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars The size chart indicated a size XL.  It's huge.
8795,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Just okay. The quality is cheap.  After a few hours of wearing it, it rides up and gets really annoying.  I won‚Äôt be buying more of these."
8796,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not my perfect fit. I like the feel and it does have good fit over all. I was looking for more length, keeps riding up would not purchase again."
8797,3,B0B16Q1854,0,fit is for teenagers not high enough in waist
8798,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Was really impressed at first but one of the three ... Was really impressed at first but one of the three shirts basically tore in half the first time it was washed

8808,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Much too transparent I so wanted to love these leggings. (I ordered small black.) They feel great, a little larger than expected but quite comfortable. Unfortunately, they are not even close to squat-proof (no matter what color underwear I try). NO WAY I could wear these in the gym. They show everything when I bend over. Sadly, I am returning them."

You order double X and they truly are 1 X Fit so I have no clue what‚Äôs going on with the company but the shirts are way way to big if they continue to give me triple X and I ordered doubleX ... I also haven‚Äôt opened them and set them aside so I‚Äôm just now finding out. Open up the package so you know your getting what you bought. This was my previous review This workout shirt is all I wear to the gym 6 days a week, I‚Äôve probably bought well over 20 pair. It‚Äôs the best out there and I‚Äôve tried them all. Just remember if your a large get an xl because it‚Äôs definitely a tight fit. I‚Äôm an xl so the I order the double xl and it fits just right."

8815,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Poor quality Did not look the same as what is represented
8816,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Disappointed These are not flattering at all they show ever single bump and make your butt look flat. They are also see through when you bend over or squat. I don‚Äôt know how they do at the gym I will not be wearing them to work out due to how thin they are.
8817,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Meh. The waist hits me more like an empire waist which I don‚Äôt particularly care for.
8818,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Just a tank top not a compression top at all The material is to thin to compress anything but other than that they aren‚Äôt that bad.

8820,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Ok for the price
8821,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Great at first, terrible after one wash These gym tanks fit very nicely upon the first time or two you wear them. After they're washed, countless snags appear on the mesh apparel making them look raggity. I cannot recommend these."
8822,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Two fit and look great but the third shirt fit and looked completely different! Loved the blue and grey in my pack and those mediums fit as expected but my black one was a slightly different design and fit. It fit baggier and I‚Äôm not happy with it which is irritating because I mainly chose this pack for the black one. It was worth for the 2 out of 3 though because I do really like those two. Fitted design and warm without being hot. I usually wear medium me the mediums of the 2 good ones were great. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 135lbs
8823,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Seam down the front of the dress ? Ok, I know clothes look different from what the model is wearing to what it looks like on me. I was hoping this item would look a little better. First, I'm kind of busty....40 DD. I thought from the other reviews that I read that the Large would fit. Unfortunately it didn't. Through the bust area was WAY too tight. Second, I can't quite figure out why the front of the garment has the seam from the &#34;V&#34; up top all the way to the bottom. Shouldn't that have been in the back? I did not care for that. It made me look like I was wearing it backwards. Third, the material is very flimsy. Poor quality fabric. So........I had to return it. The picture looks amazing, but in reality it looks cheap."
8824,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"disappointing and way small. I typically wear an XL or a 2x. I ordered this in 4x because I wanted it to be loose and flowing like in the photo. Its so small, not even what a size large should be. Veey disappointed. its a very thin t-shirt type material. Nothing at all what I expected"
8825,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Too much stretch Very stretchy.  Not much compression. I wear under shirts or athletic style undershirts under workshirts. These do not cover my chest adequately.  Lots of side cleveage. Arm holes are way to big.  Granted, I'm the only one who knows about it. But still not what I was hoping for.  Will not buy again."

8833,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,IT RUNS VERY SMALL Its does not fit like the picture. I got a large and it is like a kids size 12. I like the pattern and I will return it for a larger size.
8834,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Too Small! This was exactly what I was looking for, but I was hoping for a looser fit, so I ordered a size medium. The medium is still too small and now I wish I ordered a large or a different item altogether. I just don't want farmer's tan while jogging anymore :/"

The fabric felt cheap, then one of the eyelets for the waistband string fell off, the stuff inside then began to come out of that hole. The string ends are that cheap plastic and was already starting to get soft and appear to be breaking. And the lo and behold, there was already a hole on the pant leg seam. I sent back for a refund because I didn‚Äôt trust that getting a replacement would be beneficial given the poor quality of these joggers. I am beyond disappointed, especially since they‚Äôre not technically ‚Äúcheap‚Äù in cost: save your money and find another jogger instead."

8869,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Fit ok but not worth the money Legs are very long but otherwise fit ok. Not very flattering but comfortable.
8870,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Think burlap! I don't even like giving this item a 1 star.  The material is heavy and rough and the style is unflattering. If you like soft and comfortable these pants are not for you!
8871,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Questionable purchase. I got these on a whim for a camping trip. I wear a cotton shelf bra cami on a daily basis but i knew i was gonna be hiking and sweating all day while i was out so I decided to get these. Idk what material they're made out of but they did not feel breathable at all. In fact i felt they made me sweat more than normal and took forever to dry. Other than that they're comfortable for short workouts. At 5'9 255 lbs, they hit me at mid hip. I did find myself adjusting and pulling down the neck since i felt it kept rising up. They're fine to wear under hoodies or t shirts but straps come too close to my neck to wear under anything with an open neck. Idk if i would wear it as a stand alone shirt out in public but I wore it for yoga and weight lifting at home with a sports bra under. As far as the compression,  i cant attest to that. I got a 2xl and they felt comfortable. Not tight. Overall, i wouldn't purchase these again."
8872,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"TAKE YOUR CHANCE I cannot give this any stars.  The color is not even close to what was advertised, way too long and some funky thin cold material.  In my experience I would say be prepared to send em back if you order. Maybe I just received a bad pair. And I was looking forward to wearing them while working out. Now I guess I will just have to drink wine and look for a new pair..  üòíüòÅ"

8881,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Fit well but all the seams came undone So the dress fit perfectly and I loved it...for about an hour before it ripped on the sides. I kept wearing it with a jacket because I loved it so much but then it ripped in the back too. All the rips were directly on the seams and it definitely wasn't too small.
8882,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Exactly what I needed but small. It's not true ro size. I can live with it but no room left!
8883,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Has a weird reshape in the hip area This dress has a weird shape. It's almost like its preshaped especially in the hip area. It doesn't give much appeal to the body in my opinion.
8884,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"5'5, 140LB, 36DD. Bought and returned I was looking for a compression/thermal to wear under my scrubs at work. The product is decent for the price, but just not what I had expected. Some of the reviews said that they were warm, fitted and like a real compression shirt. I'm 5'5, 140 pounds with a DD chest size. I ordered a small in these. I was expecting a very tight fit but to my surprise they were still baggy around my stomach area and the most important place for me, the sleeves. I did not want to be constantly rolling up the sleeves when I'm wearing gloves. The material was also just very thin, and I wished they were a little thicker and warmer. The shirts would be great for some who doesnt like skin tight though!"

8928,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Poor quality These items were a complete waste of money. I ordered them to layer under my work uniform. The first day I wore one, it was frayed and practically shredded around the neck and arms. The seams came undone and it was practically falling apart. Do not recommend."
8929,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Nothing like the picture This dress looks NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. It's tight in the hips and back and somewhat flowy at the bottom so it feels really strange wearing. The pattern is also much different. The reason I'm returning is that even in black, it's completely see-through. I'm really bumped about it because it looked so cute! :("
8930,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Unflattering Like another person mentioned, the band at the top of these if VERY compressive. However the effect it causes is very unflattering. I much prefer the material the actual leggings portion is made out of as it is super soft and comfortable. I also did not like what it did in the back. Since there is no booty seam I felt it gave me a unibutt type of look which is not what I like, personally. The good aspects are it did not give a camel toe and the material (other than the waist band) is very soft."
8931,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Soso Uncomfortable
8932,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"it looks like a small or extra small WAY TOO SMALL!  I'm 5'9, 165 lbs, and wear size large. A large was sent to me and I could not even get both my arms inside the dress to slip over my head!! Looking at the circumference of the inside of the dress, it looks like a small or extra small. Length is good. Plan to give to my 5'11 size 5 daughter, but I almost doubt it may fit her?!"
8933,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Poorly made Seams break
8934,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Looks great on and super comfortable but it ripped after the ... Looks great on  and super comfortable but it ripped after the first wash.
8935,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,defective shirt This sweatshirt came with a stripe down the middle. I didn't see it and just through it in the wash before wearing it.
8936,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Terrible fit, inconsistent within the brand Very poor fit!  I have purchased other size small Russell sweatshirts that fit my female body perfectly. This one was off everywhere. Neck too tight, shoulders way too low, body too tight and sleeves too long and too bulky. Just awful!"
8937,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Two Stars way too large
8938,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Runs way too small. Way too small for what I ordered. Ended up giving to my daughter.
8939,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star Not like the description at all. Way too small.
8940,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,The material feels cheep looks more like a training bib or penny for sports teams.  It's pretty thin and you can see through it.  Plus it's not soft on your skin.  It's not like they cost a lot.  Now I know why.
8941,3,B09M6X79V9,0,not a lot of compression if your looking for something to hold you in was looking for something with a little more compression and this was not it - not a lot of hold - nice tank for everyday but thats about it
8942,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"comfortable but hard to clean I like the color, good for enlightenment, but the piling is too much and it's plenty hard to get clean, esp. the cuffs.So I wouldn't buy another one."
8943,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Poor Quality Before even wearing one of the shirts the hem was already undone.  Another shirt had extra material that was poking out due to poor stitching.  Really disappointed in quality.
8944,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"PAINFUL These fit alright, not fantastic. They kinda shove everything to the middle and I hardly have a middle to shove in the first place. They made it look like I have more of a stomach than I do, it's odd. Also, the waist rolls down non-stop.<br /> I can deal with both those issues but my main complaint is how much they hurt! The seams in the crotch are thicker and wider than any other gym leggings I've owned and they rubbed me raw.<br />I purchased these in March and they sit in the back of the drawer until all my TSLA ones from Amazon are dirty and I forget to do laundry. So since then I've only worn them maybe 5 times. Told my husband tonight to not let me wash them - they need to go straight to the garbage!"
8945,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Nice shirt for price If you plan to use this shirt for layering, error towards a size smaller. She new this shirt tends to shed."
8946,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,One Star Sad to say does not look like the picture  these are for girls they look gray on guys
8947,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Cute but doesn‚Äôt flatter curves This dress is cute and fairly well made. The polka dots were larger than expected in the design when it arrived. Ended up returning. As a busty woman, it was too tight across the chest but looked very much like a potato sack around my mid section and hips. The pockets were not flattering on my body type. The dress did not hang anything like the model. I suspect this would look great on a very thin framed person, but did not look good on my average body that has curves. I also expected the dress to be soft and cottony; it was not. Had it flattered my body type, I would have kept it."
8948,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Nice quality Nice quality but my husband preferred the Champion Powerblend hoodie instead for it has a better quality of material and fit than this Russell brand.
8949,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Good if you under 6ft Love the idea of holding it in, but it‚Äôs too short in length"
8950,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,does not fit from size chart i didn't like how it fit and i went by your size chart and the neck was way to big. All of shirt was to big all over
8951,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"WAY too short These would be good if the sizes were better. Was way too short and could not tuck it in, so I guess if you are very stubby or under 5.5 feet tall this is the shirt for you. Will not buy this junk again. Under shirts should be long enough to tuck in UNDER another shirt, instead it just rides up constantly."
8952,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ripped after 1st wear. One of the three shirts has already ripped.
8953,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Nah I don‚Äôt even understand how this top works & it was smalllll for a curvy girl
8954,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Not well made
8955,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Misleading Misleading. These are cut for tween and should be labeled ""Juniors"". Also the fabric is cheap and flimsy. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with Ralph Lauren. I was a fan for years but no more"
8956,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"Cute Dress! The dress looks as pictured. My daughter is pretty skinny, usually wears a 7/8 and I ordered a size up as suggested. The arm pit area is very large and the chest across is quite wide. Otherwise it is adorable!"
8957,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Only one of the shirts fit.. I‚Äôm M/170lbs/5‚Äô5, I ordered the medium shirts and when I tried them on, only one of the shirts fit as a medium. The other two SAID medium on the tag but there‚Äôs NO WAY. They were large if not extra large. They hung off my body and barely covered my chest. The medium fit perfectly, I love it. If only the other two had come the same way."
8958,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Does not hide belly fat! The way the description reads this shirt is equivalent to a girdle but it's not even close.  It's simply a spandex shirt which hugs my beer gut we'll but does little to shape it or hide it.
8959,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Poor quality Terrible quality. Seams started unraveling within 3 hours of the first time I wore it.
8960,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Defective Sweatshirt The sweatshirt has a ""run"" on the right side from the shoulder to the waist.  It appears as though a piece of string was pulled and left a line in the shirt that is quite obvious.  Unfortunate...."
8961,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Form fitting These are super comfortable but they do show everything. So if you have cellulite or deep stretch marks‚Ä¶they will show.
8962,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"I would order a size up from what your used to getting. This is a large, it was too tight thru the chest and waist. Will be returning for extra large, hopefully the shirt length won't be too long. Other then that, the fabric, color, weight is good quality. Only a 3 star because of the sizing issues, otherwise a 5star for quality."
8963,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Too thin, will be returning. Not fleece sweat pants, too thin! Will be returning."
8964,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Buyer Beware!! I disliked paying for the return!!  It was to small. I wanted to exchange for a larger size but I wont do that now.
8965,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Don't Like the Material Since I got this, I've realized I like the Hanes Men's Ultimate Cotton Full Zip Hood much better. I like more cotton and do not like pilling. I've had the Hanes for years and cannot find better at the price. It seems that many of the makers, even the high-priced ones, are producing with less cotton these days. I don't like the Under Armor that's twice this price in Dick's either."
8966,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Like colors Not exactly what I was expecting but will save for warmer weather. Didn‚Äôt notice it was ‚ÄúT-shirt‚Äù material
8967,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"I would suggest ordering a size down, as the waist has quite a bit of room. I like the length of the tees, but it seems to have to much room in the waist area compared to other brands that I like. Tried these because I heard about them, but probably not my favorite."
8968,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Worst product I have ever bought This is the worst product I have ever bought after seeing great reviews on amazon. Its too large, almost made to fit a bear not a human being. Never buying this brand again. Buyer Beware"
8969,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Two Stars Quality is really poor.  Very thin fabric
8970,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Three Stars Too small around the neck.
8971,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,s It's a bit bigger than expected. It'll be ok with a shirt under it which is how I'll wear it. Otherwise I'm happy with it.
8972,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Two Stars Good quality,  run very large"
8973,1,B09M6X79V9,0,no me gustaron la tela no es buena y est√°n mal hechas.
8974,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Big pocka dots Love the dress  !  IT'S JUST THE  Poka dots are to big
8975,1,B0928FSGGD,0,"Doesn‚Äôt fit the same! Each shirt is a different shape or size, I love the black one I have it fits the best but the blue and grey one is the same size the tag says but they fit way different they constantly ride up and the arms are just weird and the seam of the under arm just digs into the arm pit‚Äôs. I just don‚Äôt get it why does one of three that are supposed to be all the same size fit better then the other two. Very unfortunate buy!"
8976,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Not long lasting... Fades and changes material very very quickly Looks and feels great.  Wear it once, wash it according to instructions, and it is dull instead of shiny, and looked smooth. Now it looks like an old cotton dress, even after the very first wash"
8977,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Beach ready Soft lightly printed design. Would be great to wear to the beach
8978,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not long enough I'm 5'7&#34; and these were not nearly long enough. I just constantly have to pull them down.
8979,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Burgundy rubs off on clothes I‚Äôve washed these a million times, used shout color catchers, set with vinegar etc. The white and black shirts are fine, but the burgundy one I used the most under my white scrub top rubs off color. Disappointing because I have to hide tattoos under my scrubs and this is a perfect match to my burgundy pants! Great shirt as long as you don‚Äôt wear anything over it, and don‚Äôt even think about wearing a lighter color bra."
8980,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"too short, in my opinion. im 5'8 and ... too short, in my opinion. im 5'8 and it didnt go to my ankles. it stopped at a awkward length."
8981,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Awful Shirts are very small, I even went up a size. And they are not long by any means. I kept them just to clean around the house but I would not recommend especially if you are 5‚Äô8 or taller you may need to be 5‚Äô0 for the shirts to be long enough"
8982,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,You get what you pay for. Too short and not particularly good compression for it's supposed spandex %. I threw all 3 in the trash. Didn't want to wear a belly shirt....
8983,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Very disappointed with the overall quality of the product Poorly made:  I ran it through one wash and the seams got all winkled up and mis-aligned.  Very disappointed with the overall quality of the product!!!
8984,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Is to big is doesn‚Äôt shape your body No good fit
8985,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not the same Fits weird, gave it away. Arm sleeves are super wide and tight around the waste. Not like the old school Russell sweatshirts."
8986,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Too small These are gray tank tops but they fit too small
8987,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Wrong size Dislike will not buy I want to return it wrong size
8988,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Not like the picture Doesn‚Äôt look like the picture. Very disappointed
8989,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression material Thin material.
8990,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,I returned them They seemed to fit ok but I couldn't get over the Very visible seam stitching. And even though I got them to be under shirts It just looked very cheap.
8991,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Runs small Runs to small and causes the shirt to roll up.
8992,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Don‚Äôt fit They didn‚Äôt fit
8993,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression No compression whatsoeverevee
8994,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not for big boobs I love this dress. Only disappointment is I'm a larger chested woman and it's very tight in the chest. It fits nicely everywhere else.
8995,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Fits well, material weird I was looking for workout tank tops and these were highly rated and advertised. The fit was good, I got my normal size and had no complaints in the fit. I personally didn't like the material which was mesh, almost like those practice soccer jerseys. I was expecting a cotton blend or some polyester, but I guess I should have read all the details. I also really don't like the y-back because it is itchy for me, but that's just personal and probably not a problem for the average guy. All in all, if you don't mind the y-back and you want a very breathable mesh material, then you will love these tanks. They are just not my preference, but nothing wrong with the product. The product is good and as advertised."
8996,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"No good The dress did not look anything like the picture, end it faded really bad."
8997,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Meh nothing special. It's black, LINT MAGNET! Got it, found something similar at WalMart for like 1/4 the price so I totally wasted my money on a color I didn't even want honestly. AND you take it out of the dryer and it's all poke-doted cuz of the lint it just attaches to."
8998,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Cheap shirts These shirts are very cheaply made. I‚Äôm disappointed as the reviews were great. They seem to be tight in the front and open on the back. They are not very long as my skin will probably show when I raise my arms. The material isn‚Äôt all that comfortable either. I wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
8999,3,B0B16Q1854,0,runs big too big and not very comfortable. Keeps me warm though.
9000,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,They can't get the sizing right The sizing on this product was ridiculous.  I am not sure if they used the same measurements as the other companies to define small medium and large.  Usually a large is a bit tight on me.  Each shoulder had at least a spare two inches and the chest had an extra five.  I was swimming in it.
9001,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Dont order if ur not 100% sure of size Didn't fit like A size  2xl and  getting  a refund on it has been total hassle

9007,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Very small! If you want these to be even the slightest bit loose, size up 2 sizes. 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 125 pounds and the mediums were like leggings. I gave them to my 12 year old daughter. Fabric is great, but sizing is so small."
9008,3,B07XD71F1H,0,This is a gift chosen by the recipient. As expected for the price. This is a gift.
9009,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Two Stars They didn't fit as expected.
9010,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Color does not match photos The color was not was it showed in the photos in amazon. It‚Äôs a much lighter color and not what it looks like at all.
9011,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"A relaxed fit This item is advertised as compression.  I have a small and wear a medium, the fabric is soft and comfortable, however it does not offer any compression at all. It's more of a relaxed fit."
9012,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Tight fit. I am plus sized woman, I got a size bigger than I thought I'd need and they were still tight; best example would be it fits like a juniors tee instead of a woman's. The fabric isn't the most flattering either. Luckily I bought these to be undershirts for my outfits."
9013,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,It will do Just wish it was a little heavier
9014,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Shirt slides up Not for regular torso, a bit short. The material slides the shirt up words as you work out."
9015,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Fit for very overweight people I'm about 6'1&#34; and 200lbs. I wouldn't call myself fat but skinny I am not. I usually wear a size large shirt and so I ordered a large. The length is about right but this shirt is clearly intended for an obese person. It will not fit you like the model in the picture. To take that picture the photographer pinned back the excess fabric. I wouldn't order this shirt in any size unless you're at least a good 50 lbs over weight.
9016,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I was disappointed because the material was too thin I bout this dress and polka dot shoes for the red night on my sister's honeymoon cruise. I was disappointed because the material was too thin, very tight around my breast area. Most disappointing was the seam of the dress was in the front right down the middle and tge tag was in the back of dress so I knew I was putting it on  correctly. I can't wear it again so I've waisted my money."

9019,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Cute but low cut They were so soft and cute. I'm giving a 3 star because at 5'8 and 140 lbs they are too low cut for this mom. I didn't want to squat it bend over and have my underwear keep showing.

9028,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Cute but too small These are really tiny so I returned them.

9042,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Should not be labeled as a compression top!! These should NOT be labeled as compression tops. They are nothing more than thin polyester tank tops - athletic style, but that's all. There is absolutely 0% support/compression in the material, so if you're looking for something that helps tuck in and flatten/smooth any love handles; or keep your curvy chest in check while vigorously exercising (as compression tops are SUPPOSED to do) you're going to be seriously disappointed. I am debating whether to keep my set for cycling, and kayaking because there's not a lot of bouncing in those sports and these shirts will make a fine moisture wicking base layer. Be warned if you're doing anything that requires a lot of jumping, bouncing, etc. where you need actual compression clothing, these shirts are not for you. The inside tags have NO information on them other than size, so you have to know how to wash and care for polyester clothing. If you're a busty girl (bigger than a 34 C cup) you're going to have a problem where the shirt is likely going to be too short for comfort. This happens because a lot of the material gets stretched over your bosom, leaving your mid drift with slim to nothing to cover it. The stitching on all three of my shirts looks pretty strong and tidy, so I'm hopeful these won't fall apart when washed. Size wise, I went with an XL and I am happy that I did. While I usually wear a medium to large in US clothing, XL on these shirts just barely fits comfortably."
9043,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Compression? Stretchy and compression are two different things. These definitely fall under stretchy which is, at best, compression adjacent.<br /><br />If you are looking for control this is not the product for you; however, if that is not a feature you require, they make good undershirts."
9044,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Not worth the price. For $30 plus I‚Äôd expect a heavier hoodie. This felt like a rebranded fruit of the loom hoodie from Walmart. Super thin left ‚Äúfuzzies‚Äù all over my undershirt. As a taller guy the hoodie fit short and wide. Will definitely not by again. Actually wanted to return them but ended up just giving them to a couple of homeless guys as they were just sitting in my car for 2 weeks.

9048,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very disappointed! These razorback shirts are NOT compression shirts, at all. The only reason I am giving this one star is for the delivery time.<br />The quality of these shirts are not great. I am very disappointed. I should not have to go to the trouble of returning items that I thought was true to the description."

We live on the beach and I live in sundresses...this will be a perfect item to throw on after a day in the sun..I wouldn't call it an evening dress!  I would wear it out to dinner, etc...we live in a beach community which is very casual...material was certainly not a cotton blend, but its comfortable.  I think is was a good value for the money....but probably would not order another one!"
9057,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Sizeup especially if you are busty.
9058,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Do not buy if you are tall These are very short if you are over 6 foot tall they will not fit you
9059,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Size Fits a little bigger than I‚Äôd expected. I should‚Äôve ordered a large instead of x-large
9060,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Black stains Run to big and it was TWO  BIG Black STAINS!!
9061,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not true to size and keeps sliding down I do not like this leggings at all. It is very uncomfortable and keeps sliding down. The sizing is also way off so I returned it.
9062,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,uncomfortable; not like sweat shirt material bought as Christmas present.  poor material; not like sweat shirt quality.
9063,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"la talla no es la se√±alada size is not marked buy a size S, but the spare is large sleeves is a size M, the seller should correct this.<br />The quality no complaints so far, we will see in time"

9065,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"The trend seems to be pulled apart easily After washing the product, I noticed the thread of the material coming loose."

9067,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Shedding Fleece in Sweatshirt The sweatshirt must be washed prior to wearing it. The fleece shed all over the shirt my husband was wearing. In my opinion, the sweatshirt should be pre washed in the factory, or there should be a warning on the sweatshirt about the need for washing it prior to wearing it."
9068,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not actually a compression garment Fabric is too thin to actually be used as a compression garment. Itis also made of a mix of materials that is itchy if worn for more than 3 hours. ""seller"" also contacted me after review of their service to ask for my shipping/mailing info to send me more stuff. I mean they had the info when they mailed the original order, so why do they want my info through an email? Sketchy"
9069,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Fast Fading Color Soft and warm.  A little on the long but that's to be expected with a hoodie. Loved the collegiate blue color when it arrived. Only washed it in cold water and dried it flat. The color faded faster than a 90s boy band. Still warm, still soft, and still fits. It just looks washed out and dull."
9070,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"there are no pockets which the picture implies there are and worst of all it was about 5"" too short This dress was cute in theory, but the seam is in the front weird, there are no pockets which the picture implies there are and worst of all it was about 5&#34; too short, I am only 5'8&#34;"
9071,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Uncomfortable They fit good, but when I started walking, they kept sticking to my butt and legs..it's like a static feeling because of the material, so it's really uncomfortable and looks weird."
9072,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Cheap This dress was cheap didn't even take it  all the way out of the bag.
9073,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Comfortable Thinner material than i like... i may need a smaller size.

9075,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"who designed this? It‚Äôs  Horrible. Looks like a badly made bathrobe. Tried to send it back. They offered $5 refund to keep it, then $8. Decided it was cheaper to take the $8 and keep it. Guess I‚Äôll use it in a quilt!"
9076,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Run big I ordered a small and it‚Äôs way too big!!! No compression for me . I need a extra small

9080,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Usually fine. Have bought several over the years and they have been good. This one the pocket ripped the first time I put something in it.
9081,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Did not like the material They look nothing like the picture you have to at least go up a size maybe two they‚Äôre made very small and did not like the material whatsoever it felt like if I exercise in them they would stick to me so I sent them back
9082,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Not awesome I love the look but i ordered a size large so they would be baggy and they fit like a med. They are not super soft on the inside like most sweats when you first buy them. They also came with a big gap in the seem of my leg.
9083,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Too short
9084,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Two Stars nice material...but runs far smaller than a 5X
9085,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not actual compression tops They are cheaply made spandex tanks. The stitching and seems look cheap. If you just need something to workout in they will probably hold up long enough to warrant the price, but they aren't good quality. I was looking for true compression tops like the product says they are, but there's no real compression of any kind. I'll be returning and looking elsewhere."
9086,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Light color pink The sweatshirt fits great,but the color is not the bright pink that is in the picture. It‚Äôs a light pink. Not what I wanted but didn‚Äôt want to send it back."
9087,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE Absolutely NOTHING like the picture. The front comes above the waist, the shoulder line is lower on one side than the other (poor sewing), and goes below the collar bone. The color is that of a more burnt orange and and teal, not bright colors at all. Returning for Refund."
9088,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Color Spot On Size and Comfort well... Runs small! 2XL on 5*3 female at 110pounds it only went to my waist. Was snug and not rugged feeling material. Not warm and loose. Color is spot on.  But too short in waistline and necktag keeps popping up in back of hood. Poorly made
9089,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Shirts It's a bit tight, a bit short... Other than that love these shirts, great to work in"
9090,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Too big,so no actual  compression benefit Not a true to size...too big,loose fit"
9091,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Scratchy Not the material I was looking for.  Sizes aren't standard (order next size up to two sizes larger).
9092,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Smaller fit Order a bigger size than you normally wear because they come in a slightly smaller size
9093,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Item does not look like picture! The fit is fine even tho the listing says it runs small. But the item in NO WAY resembles the picture.
9094,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Not sized right. This fits huge in some areas and tight in others. Very cheap material.
9095,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not as expected! Short and not fitted as described. They were not fitted and too short!
9096,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not compression gear! No where near a &#34;Compression&#34; top!! My husband is 5'9 & 215lbs and we ordered a medium. ... they fit like a regular fit tee.

9098,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"flat butts only They ride incredibly low on the hips. Like hilariously. I thought I'd bought men's pants at first because they were so straight cut. Basically don't sit, breathe, or bend over all day and you should be fine. I'll be returning mine for sure."
9099,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars A little big
9100,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Uneven seams! Spend a little extra money and purchase a better quality tank top. The seams are uneven and very unflattering!
9101,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"The best leggings I honestly worried that they wouldn‚Äôt fit me so I go these leggings and todaaaa they fit! They make me even look confident and good! I wanna buy another pair! 10/10 will try again<br /><br />Update: after a few wears, holes started to form and they sadly ripped out of nowhere plus they fuzz up too quickly. So 3 1/2 out of 10"
9102,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not bad The chest to waist ratio is off. The waist is too loose. I normally wear a medium t shirt and went small on these.  The chest and shoulders fit right but the waist is kinda loose.
9103,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Runs big Runs big but looks like good Material !
9104,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Product not as pictured Product is nothing like the picture. It stops halfway from knees to ankles, the top of the dress reminds me of a night gown instead of a v-neck cut. The material is thin a cheap... not cute at all!! Returning product"
9105,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,WTH? I bought L black ones that were fine ordered white and they came in size S with a L tag.
9106,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression at all These are NOT anything compression like. I bought these to go over my sports bra when working out for extra support. These tanks do nothing for support.
9107,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Very soft and stretchy tank, NO compression at all! No Compression at all!"
9108,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Shows your cellulite This product had a lot of hype around it. The material is comfortable but isnt meant for tall girls. I am 5‚Äô7 and it does not go down to my ankles nor does it even touch them, which may be okay for the summer but not so much the winter. I also ordered the light blue pair and it‚Äôs a great color just shoes a lot of imperfections aka your cellulite. I‚Äôd also be cautious of sweating in the blue and showing sweat marks thru the fabric. Hoping if I order the black that won‚Äôt be a problem"
9109,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars adhesive on labels will not come off. would order more if not for that
9110,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Smell like B.O.! Resold maybe? ü§¢üòï So these shirts fit well enough, and the design is great‚Äîbut the material is super itchy and scratchy. On top of that, and what makes these unwearable for me‚Äîthey smell! Like, they smell like they‚Äôve been worn and have body odor. Maybe it‚Äôs the material, or maybe they were re-sold? After washing, there is still enough of a faint armpit smell that def is not my own and makes me gag."
9111,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,wrong color was sent twice i like the leggings but i ordered the green color and the blue was sent not once but twice.
9112,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Sent it back If you‚Äôre looking for something light weight, look elsewhere. This thing is very bulky and very heavy, and wears more like a hefty sweatshirt than a light weight jacket. Seems to run big as well."
9113,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars basically returned as was not to my liking
9114,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Extremely small [[VIDEOID:baf23ae09cfada333130f69f9160bc6]] Extremely small. I ordered a 3x because I wanted baggy workout shirts. These were SKIN TIGHT! In the photo I have it sitting on a XL from Target and it's about half the size
9115,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Nice summer dress I loved this dress it was comfortable and fit perfectly. I alway loved that is has pockets.
9116,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Poor quality material. Poor quality material. The dress was clingy in a bad way and see through.
9117,3,B09M6X79V9,0,comfortable fit but but but it kept rolling up to my waist which I did not like
9118,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Shrunk after one wash I washed this once with cold water on low heat, and it shrunk a size and a half (but the sleeves stay just as baggy).  Get a different hoddie. Turst me."
9119,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Runs small Runs very small I usually wear a small/medium. Definitely need a large.
9120,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Quality sucks The quality of these tanks sucks so I‚Äôll definitely won‚Äôt be wearing them.
9121,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Sizes lie Ordered a 2x. Was sent a pair with a safety pin tag that said 2x but the actual pants tag said xl. Don‚Äôt buy, they‚Äôre not true to size."
9122,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Dress for younger women It‚Äôs a cute dress. Shorter than I thought it would be. The bust is small and fits tight. The pattern is much larger than the picture.
9123,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Buyers beware Item I received was worn by someone with a lot of hair and the pocket was torn
9124,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Good but not great I‚Äôm usually a large but ordered a size up as suggested and glad I did! However I feel like they are thin and a little short in the arms. The shirt lays above my wrist bone and I prefer workout shirts a little longer.
9125,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Great sweatshirt Great sweatshirt
9126,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"One pair great, the other is see through I have bought 2 pairs- one is great, the other is super see through. LOVE LOVE LOVE the green ones. I'm a legging snob and will pay good money for good leggings. These fit perfectly, have compression, don't ride down, and are squat proof. Feel like expensive leggings. I have some cellulite on my legs and butt and so I can almost never get away with wearing much besides black leggings without it showing through, but these light green ones hide it. I'm 5'6 145 pounds and got a medium.<br /><br />The black ones, though, are super see through and will be going back. Disappointed and unsure of why these two leggings are so different."
9127,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Runs large and short. Didn't fit as well as it appeared, chest. Too loose."
9128,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,No long enough The picture shows this long enough to cover the backend but it is not.  In the back it comes to my waist
9129,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Small fit I wear a 2x and went ahead and bout 3x. It fits a little smaller than a 2x normally would. I recommend buying a size up. It will still be compressed. The fabric is nice and thick and covers the front and back bellow the waist.
9130,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Go two sizes down I bought a size down, and there was no compression. I usually wear a large sized shirt, and I should have ordered a small."
9131,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Don't like the fabric.
9132,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Sizes too small and not as described Fit was too small not as expected or stated
9133,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Compression very loose This item did not compress as expected. Very loose and stretchy.
9134,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Material to thin.
9135,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Too tight Going to get the next size up and hope this fits bettet
9136,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Shirts This product was way different from the pictures when I got it it was too big or too loose and didn‚Äôt look like the pictures
9137,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Order a size larger than normal I got the wrong size from what I ordered, emailed them and never heard anything back. After washing, I recommend ordering on the bigger side. I got an XL and it fits well"
9138,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"fits small in body but long in length and arms UPDATE lowered my stars b/c one shirt is a different size when I went to wear it.  It's too small and I can't send back b/c its a set. Not the best customer service on that either, I tried.<br />I ordered XL first time (I normally would buy a L or XL) and it was tighter than I would want in the body but long in arm length and body length.  I went back and bought a XXL and it was VERY long in the body and arms but fit ok in the body. I am taller too at 5'8 1/2 this still was long.  So weird fit but the material is nice, colors are bright and I wear these under tee shirts.  I haven't put the moisture wicking to the test fully yet as I keep reverting back to my favorite under armour long sleeve which works amazing but is old and needs to be replaced (hence why I bought these)."
9139,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not all the same In pack of 3 They are not all made of the same fabric
9140,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Poor quality & bad seller The cardigan is very thin material & is poor quality. The make/design of the cardigan isn‚Äôt as it shows in the pictures . Requested a refund & the seller never responded. Not the way to do business. Won‚Äôt purchase from this seller again & I advise anyone to avoid this seller because they do not do business well & products are poor quality.
9141,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Sizing is off Not near the size it said it was.  It says it runs a little small.  I wear an xlg so I ordered a 3xlg and couldn‚Äôt get it over my head.  That isn‚Äôt running a little small!
9142,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Three Stars a bit shorter than expected or a 5t child
9143,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Ok but not as expected I don‚Äôt feel they are a true compression garment.
9144,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Too long for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 hits mid calf.. Cute & comfy.
9145,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Cute and fits but came with a hole in them. I like them and they fit well but they arrived with a hole where the stitching came apart on the leg so I have to fix them before I can wear them out of the house.  So that's disappointing.
9146,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Sizing I usually wear an XS in shorts like this but I purposely ordered up to a M and they‚Äôre SUPER tiny. Like kids size M or something. I can‚Äôt even wear them. So I just wasted money. Do not order
9147,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Size, material This product is extremely small and I sized up. I have tried to contact the seller and have not be able to."
9148,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Wrong color pink It‚Äôs comfortable and fits well but they sent me a light pink instead of the pink it shows
9149,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars just what i expected
9150,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Cheap made I washed then like I do all my new  cloths didn't even get them on when the eyelet  came off. Leaving a big hole and stuff coming out.
9151,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression at all These are not compression shirts they are just under shirts
9152,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not good as compression shirts They make comfortable undershirts but they're definitely not good as compression shirts. I got a size smaller and they feel like nothing more than a somewhat tight undershirt.
9153,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Need to order a size down,  Not compression material I'm 6ft4, 235lbs athletic. I wear an XL tee shirt.<br />I ordered the XL, it's a very comfortable sheet top, but not a compression material. Even if I'd ordered the L (size smaller) its just not a compression fit.<br />They are nice tops though,  but that's my 2 cents."
9154,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Not bad Runs a little long. The material is thin and its almost see through. Overall decent purchase
9155,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Cheaply Made Of poor quality, cheaply made and thin. They were returned."
9156,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not for tall gals. It's a bit tight in the chest and was way too short on me.  I am 5'11&#34;, 38D. Due to the length, it fell in a very awkward way on me."
9157,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Three Stars Thinner material than I expected.
9158,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,No fue lo que esperaba No me agrado porque supuestamente es para comprimir el est√≥mago pero no es como se ense√±a en la foto y en realidad no me sirvieron.
9159,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Dress Too loose on top and too long
9160,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Order a larger size Order a larger size
9161,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Thin and small The material is very thin. It runs small and is tight in upper arms.
9162,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Fits on the size of smaller but great price! Fits on the side of smaller, but great price! Haven't washed yet to see how much more it will shrink!"
9163,1,B076QD9NP1,0,One Star
9164,1,B09M6X79V9,0,They run to small Runs small
9165,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not the dress pictured The picture of the model wearing the dress shows small polka dots.  The dress I received has large polka dots and not what I was expecting. I considered returning the dress, but my daughter convinced me to keep it."
9166,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Nice dry fit tee Snug fit
9167,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Sleeves are huge The sleeves on the small are as big as sleeves for extra large!
9168,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Size runs a little big I liked the material, but I found the size to run larger than what I expected.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 / 160 lbs and the (medium) tops were way to loose and the length was long.  I‚Äôm Reordering a size (small)."
9169,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not for athletes These ride, need a built in sports bra or they will slide on you"
9170,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"I like this item but.... I bought these items as a option to replace cutting up t-shirts that get frayed and such.  I love the fit and material, but one stitch gets pulled and you have that annoying line in shirt, and its all down hill from there."
9171,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Very Baggy Got one size too big according to chart and the shirts swallowed me. Could‚Äôve fit myself 3 times inside.
9172,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Careful of certain colors, fit entirely different. Overall, I love the tanks. I bought the black, red, and gray. I'm 5'11 and weigh 190, athletic build. Black and red fit perfect as a size M. The gray one was a different story. Shirt tag said M but it might as well fit like a large. Maybe it was a manufacturing error, but the gray definitely does not fit as the black and red do. If they could get the sizing consistent between all colors then I would definitely leave these tanks a 5/5 rating."
9173,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Pills I wasn't very pleased with this sweatshirt,it was stated anti pill but it is terrible I've tried everything for it not to pill but with no success,too bad to because I love the color"
9174,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"These shirts aren't bad. They fit fine but constantly rise up when ... These shirts aren't bad. They fit fine but constantly rise up when I'm working out, which gets really old fast!"
9175,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not as pictured Not as long and loose as pictured. Still cute, but definitely misrepresented."
9176,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Very cheap and clingy material. This dress is paper thin and made poorly. Definitely not worth the purchase.
9177,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Wife didn‚Äôt like it at all Bought this for my wife and she didn‚Äôt like this at all - I‚Äôm going to return it.
9178,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Just a tad too short, order a size larger than you think. It's a shame because I ordered my usual size, and everything from the Ribcage and up is PERFECT!  but the shirt is a tad to short so if I'm working out and Bend over or Stretch by leaning backwards, it exposes skin.  That is my only problem with them is just slightly too short in the torso, other than that they are great!"
9179,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"and athletic shirts in that size fit me pretty tightly, so I purchase XL thinking they'd be ... Usually I wear a large, and athletic shirts in that size fit me pretty tightly, so I purchase XL thinking they'd be a little looser. Not so in this case. When I opened them I thought I'd received the wrong size, but the tags said XL. They look like a tight medium and fit me like a second skin. I showed them to a friend and asked what size she thought they were. She said Medium. They're fine for me to wear under other workout shirts, but I didn't intend to layer them with other clothes."
9180,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not at all what I expected. These are advertised as compression fitting.  They are not.  They are very thin and do not support anything.  I might as well be wearing a sleeveless T-shirt.  Definitely will not worth the price and won't purchase again.
9181,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Decent, but Workmanship is Shoddy I'll start with the good and make my way to the bad. First, I bought this hoodie (dark green) for work as that's the colors of my employer. I work outside year-round so I needed something to keep myself warm during the cold season. For that part, it definitely fits the bill and helps to keep me warm when the cold hits. It's somewhat thick and is warmer than the hoodie that was given to me by my employer so it gets quite a bit of use. The XL fits me perfectly, no complaints as I prefer my shirts to be a bit more loose fitting to allow for flexibility when on the move.<br /><br />The bad? Well, this hoodie was purchased at the end of November and it already has a hole where the wrist cuff meets the sleeve. It's not a hole from abuse, the thread is simply coming undone already. I can likely repair it by sewing it back together but I'm not too impressed with the quality of workmanship after only a month and a half of use. I have other hoodies that I've owned for years that have been through far more abuse and other than typical degradation from years of washing and wearing, are still in decent shape.<br /><br />Second and even more annoying is the string for the hoodie. It's not secured in place like you'd see in others where there's a channel sewn in to keep it from moving around inside the hood. Every time it's washed, I have to fish the string from somewhere inside the hood back to the edge where it belongs. If it weren't for the knots tied to prevent the string from getting pulled out entirely, it would have already. Again, it's pretty easily fixable by hand sewing but this is another example of shoddy workmanship. I guess you get what you pay for and fortunately, I caught this hoodie when the price was low. It makes me wonder if it's a reject.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent hoodie and does the job I need it to which is keep me warm when it gets cold. Had I known about these problems previous to purchase, I probably would have looked elsewhere though."
9182,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Three Stars Okay, but thinner than sweat shirts were made in the past"
9183,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Bright colors Love the style just doesn't fit someone with broad shoulders.  Might want to go a size bigger as well
9184,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Thin sweatshirt The fabric is not as thick as Russell products we have purchased in the past.
9185,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Too small even with bigger size Fits even smaller than advertised. Quite tight and i ordered bigger than the chart said.
9186,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Disappointed This is much heavier than it looks.
9187,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Weird cut This could be a cute dress if it didn't have hips sew into it. It has this really, really weird hem that sticks out to attempt to give an ""hour glass"" shape to the dress at the hips. Well not everyones hips are at the same place. I'm 5-0"" so this area of the dress hits me mid thigh making me look large. I could see this fitting in the correct place for taller people. I really don't understand why a dress would be stitched this way."
9188,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Not a quality product Very thin, and parts of the seem already had holes."
9189,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"To my smaller fitted gals... Medium is a perfect fit for someone who's on the smaller side of medium, I ordered a medium sweatshirt and that thing was huge on me, its important to remember every brand has there own size chart, which I did not pay attention to. Good luck, hope this helps!"
9190,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Returned. I did not like the fit or material, returned these immediately. Seem very cheaply made. I knew I would never want to wear them."
9191,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star Not great. Material is not what I was expecting and they run small.
9192,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Sleeves have gotten shorter over the years. I have several older Russell sweatshirts and liked them a lot.  They were 2-3 years old.  I bought 2 in the past month, one was this hoodie, the other with no hood.  The sleeves on both are at least an inch shorter than the old sweatshirts.  I sent one back, gave the hoodie to a nephew, and am now buying my sweatshirts from a local store where I can try them on.  Whoever is now making the Russell sweatshirts is trying to save on material cost by taking it out of the sleeves, I guess."
9193,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Somewhat recommended... Much thinner than I expected. Feels a bit cheap. Bought for my daughter and was concerned it would be too small. She says it fit ok and that it would be nice worn with other layers. Definitely not what I was expecting when I ordered, but it was an &#34;OK&#34; garment."
9194,3,B09M6X79V9,0,... excited about the material but that was probably my bad. Fit really small and wasnt really excited about the material but that was  probably my bad.
9195,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Black ones are no where near squat proof!!! Although they are super comfy they are very see throw. I am very upset because the description said they are mostly squat proof but they are in no way squat proof. I‚Äôm very upset with this purchase. I purchased another color just waiting on it to come in. I‚Äôll update once they come in.
9196,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Sadly disappointed Tag in the back itches like crazy.  Removed the tag and could still feel the spot it was in.
9197,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Pockets are accidentally sewn closed Cute but the pockets are accidentally sewn too small.  Frustrating because I had to open the pocket and resew it.  returned the first  one and second had same issue but with other pocket
9198,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Just another tank top This does not have a built in bra as described
9199,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Fits comfortably Loose fit if you normally wear a large.
9200,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"not what I expected Since this was so popular, I gave it a try.  I ordered a black tunic and it was awful.  The fabric was sheer and completely see through.  It was cheap and not at all what I anticipated.  I would have given it zero stars if I could."
9201,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Good for the cost Oversized, but warm and comfy. Good for the cost. I use it primarily under a second layer and so the looks don't matter, but this would look very ugly if worn by itself."
9202,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Great fit. Poor quality fabric. I really liked this dress when I first wore it. The fit was great and it looked as good as the picture. The fabric is soft and stretchy, not baggy. The length is good. (I'm 5 ft 6, 153 ib, and ordered a Large)<br />HOWEVER.... After wearing it once, to dinner, I washed it in cold water on the delicate cycle, and hung it up to air dry.<br />The black color FADED. Now it looks like an old, rather worn dress after JUST ONE washing.<br />I'm very disappointed and considered sending it back, but feel I can't because it's  (obviously) not in New Condition anymore."
9203,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Polyester fabric that clings to you. Weird pink shade in pattern.  
9204,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Three Stars Fit is good. I wish the material was softer. Feels cheap, but it is so that's expected"
9205,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Seams ripped out on first wash. Very disappointing. Seam ripped out after 1st washing.
9206,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Awesome Fit.  Super Comfy.  Smells like B.O. Judging by another review, I'm not the first person to complain about the smell.  There's something about this particular fabric and the smells that generate when in contact with human skin (and not even sweating heavily).  The shirts go from smelling like nothing and then reeking of basically nasty body odor.<br /><br />It's definitely not me, because I put one both before and after showering, and the result is the same: stanky smells.<br /><br />Very unfortunate because the fit is awesome and they look great.  I haven't washed/dried them yet...but I'm skeptical if that would even matter."
9207,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Two Stars NICE SHIRT BUT DID NOT CARE FOR THE WAY IT FIT.  SENT BACK WITH NO PROBLEM
9208,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Decent, but shrinks The product seems see-through but it's not on the body which is nice. Material seems mediocre. My husband is muscular so the tanks fits nicely UNTILS you was them. They shrink about a size so prepare for that. My husband is a L, so we ordered that but after washing it's about a M. So account for that or air dry it"
9209,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Not what I expected The dress looks better in the picture
9210,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheap quality On the first wash the lining around the arms came undone.  I was able to wear it once on vacation and one of the three was done.  The other 2 are hanging in there with small parts of the threading unraveling.
9211,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Just okay... Material is cheap and no compression. Could be a little more tighter, but since the material is cheap, it might rip."
9212,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,One Star Received damaged - badly sewn garment. Size Large probably for boys not mens. Buyer beware.
9213,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Beware of camel toe I love these leggings, I really do. But right after I cut off the tag (of course) I noticed that no matter how I wear these, I can have a pretty apparent camel toe if I am not careful.<br />The material and fit of these are so nice, so I may wear them around the house or somehow shimmy them to not do that, but just beware of that problem when purchasing.<br />Otherwise, these are stellar!"
9214,1,B0B16Q1854,0,This.product is really short not long.like on the model The material looks thicker than description
9215,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Want money back wouldn‚Äôt buy again Comfort is important to me and the pants did not fit the were to small
9216,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Two Stars Not happy with how it fits. Very weird fitting in the top .
9217,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,One Star Have to play tug of war to keep shirts from riding up my torso.
9218,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"One sleeve shorter than the other In the pic, that sleeve is not pulled up. One is considerably shorter than the other.<br /><br />I also don‚Äôt like the print. Very mottled. I think I‚Äôll keep them and layer over them but won‚Äôt wear just these shirts in public. I don‚Äôt plan to wear the purple one ever. Too weird with that one short sleeve.<br /><br />I ordered a medium and they are shorter and tighter than I like. I‚Äôm usually a small."
9219,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Shorter Love the pattern and feel of fabric.  However it's not as long in photo.  Hits at belt length.
9220,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"They run large. I returned them, they were larger than expected."
9221,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Smaller than described size Its a pack of three n all have different measurements with same size tag.
9222,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Pilling after one washing. Junk! One washing and ALL 3 sweatshirts have pilling all over the cuffs and collar, as well as elsewhere! Unexpected since I have 2 older Russell sweatshirts with zero issues after dozens of washes! I'm gonna ask for refund!"

9224,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Sizing - more TTS than the reviews say The suggestions in comments and the product tester encouraged to size down. I wish I wouldn't have done that, but otherwise they are super soft and comfy1"
9225,2,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Length is too long The length of the shirt is too long
9226,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Dress Need better sizing chart
9227,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Unsatisfactory If you‚Äôre ok with just a basic stretchy tank, this might work. Unfortunately I was specifically wanting a compression tank and this is not it. They are pretty thin, far too thin to be considered ‚Äúcompression‚Äù. I‚Äôd look elsewhere for your compression needs."
9228,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Too large, material too thin Too thin, fits way too large"
9229,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Shirt not as advertised ""Compression"" shirt is trash. It felt like a slightly thicker and stretch tank top! Do not buy!!!!!"

9231,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,... large and have received a medium which fits much better.. we've returned the large and have received a medium which fits much better...
9232,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Quality shirt but a little shorter than advertised.
9233,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"so don't wear your favorite light Cami underneath them I gave these shirts a 3 star rating because I typically wear a medium and had to order an xl. To top it off, they came in in an xxl. They fit perfectly. The red and black do bleed, so don't wear your favorite light Cami underneath them. The white is completely see through, so you'll need to wear a Cami underneath definitely. They're very thin, but it works well for the gym."
9234,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Large I love these But I got a size XL and I wear a Large. I should have gone up to XXL
9235,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not a lot of compression The material on these shirts are really nice and they don't have 'elastic' looking lines running through it like other shirts do; HOWEVER, this is probably why they are not really compression shirts.  My husband said the shirts were nice to wear for a lightweight hold but it doesn't really compress or hold anything from jiggling around.  Maybe if you bought it a size or two smaller?  I order an XL in both the Roc Bodywear and this but I'll be returning these and buying more of the Roc as he loves how they hold everything firmly (he has lost over 70 lbs so far)."
9236,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Disappointed- way too tight I am 5‚Äù2 and 111 lbs- 26 inch waist, hips about 37 inches- size small was way too small- literally ‚Äúsquished‚Äù my ass and gave me a pancake butt. They are cut completely the same from front to back- so they do not allow any room in the butt department (I don‚Äôt even have a big butt). They are not see through and are okay for squats- but the tightness made them uncomfortable for squatting for me. Probably size medium would have worked better."
9237,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"This product was not good. I ordered a 3x because I read that ... This product was not good. I ordered a 3x because I read that the sizes ran a bit small, but this was ridiculous... it fits more like a medium. I was highly disappointed in the texture (so thin) & how small it fit. I would not recommend this product to any plus size person... (I'm a 1x)"
9238,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not flattering at all, weird fit and material The waistband is too compressive in comparison to the rest of the material, which if you don‚Äôt have washboard abs, makes your waist/hip area look really odd, it is almost too high waisted if you‚Äôre a short gal like me 5‚Äô2, the worst part of all is how unflattering they‚Äôre on the butt, they make it seem really flat, unibutt and square (because of the difference in compressions in the waistband vs all the other fabric). The material was kind of itchy, felt really cheap, and overall I really didn‚Äôt like them at all, I‚Äôm returning them. I‚Äôd say if you don‚Äôt care about how your butt looks while working out then they might be a good fit, however I think there are way better gymshark dupes (the wodowei gymshark dupes are great for example).<br /><br />In regards sizing, I‚Äôm normally an M, I sized down, and they were still kind of big and I‚Äôll fitting. Would  not recomend them to be honest."
9239,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,... don't quite match the reality and the stitching is poor quality. The colors online don't quite match the reality and the stitching is poor quality.
9240,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"XL fits like old XXL Bought 2 XL sweatshirts.  Compared to my least shrunk, largest Russell XL (also a 50/50 cotton/polyester, so it shouldn't have shrank much), the new sweatshirts are perhaps a whole size larger.<br /><br />I can't imagine these sweatsheats shrink 3/23= 13%, but perhaps they do.  The new one measures 3&#34; longer in torso length than the old one, and 4&#34; longer in sleeves.  The circumference of torso and sleeves is proportionally larger as well.<br /><br />I'm returning the XLs and ordering replacement Ls.  Good thing I'm trialing Prime right now.<br /><br />The quality seems as good as the old shirts, maybe better."
9241,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Extremely disappointed Extremely thin!! Not all for winter weather!!
9242,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too short The length was not as long as I like.
9243,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,great price It arrived sooner then expected.  And the fit was ok.  Not sure if it will shrink once washed but it was priced great. Every where else I searched offered it at a lower price but shipping it was more then the product. So I got a great deal on the sweater with free shipping so I would definitely purchase from them again.
9244,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Do not recommend Too small and too short for a medium I‚Äôm normally a small but bc of the material I bought what I thought was a size up ... it fits like a extra small and short at that my belly almost shows
9245,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Cheap material The material is cheap and it ripped within a couple of wears.
9246,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,True to size Dress could be a little longer but it's acceptable.
9247,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Unflattering material if you have meat This is so unflattering if you are not skinny or do not have a flat stomach. It‚Äôs basically a stretchy fitted tank. There is no support and really no compression. I am 5‚Äô1 138 pounds. I am usually a small/medium. I got a small and glad I did. It rolls a little and if I got a bigger one it would roll more. I kept it because I am working out at home so I don‚Äôt care how I look. If I wouldn‚Äôt wear this to the gym because I would feel self conscious.
9248,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Ok These are impossible to bend over in without flashing someone! Low cut, otherwise also run a bit tight in the thigh area vs normal joggers. Ok purchase but unless you‚Äôre rail thin these probably won‚Äôt be very flattering on you."
9249,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Didn‚Äôt hold up through the wash. These fit awesome straight out of the package. After only only one wash, the upper portion of the tank shrank and the lower portion stretched out to approximately twice the size that it was before. Too bad because the price was right and I was ready to buy more."
9250,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Mostly a great dress I love how this dress fits. I bought a large, even though I usually wear a medium. I am 5'4&#34;, 150 lbs and a 36C. It fits loose and flowy like I wanted it to. The problem is the seam running down the front of the dress where the pattern doesn't match up. If you could turn the dress backwards it would be perfect, but the hem is a high low so that looks odd to have the high part in back. I'm keeping the dress anyway."

9252,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not slimming Not only does this product not provide any slimming effect but it's not compression either this is just a stretchy tank top that's it
