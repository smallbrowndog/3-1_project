5,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Exactly what I needed for a gym shirt Bought this to wear to the gym. It fit as expected and held up well after washing. No shrinking after drying and the material is good. I’d buy another if I need more in the future.

21,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Great tie dye.  It was for my grandson.  He loved it.
22,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Almost great I took my measurements in order to get the right fit, but it still was a little off. I love the dress, however, so I will keep it and a couple of alterations to make it fit. I'll have to take in the hips... my waist is thicker, so apparently I am also supposed to have a pair of formidable hips to match. I don't. I will also the have to do a couple of small darts to lessen the gaping armhole areas. When that iui s done, though, the dress will be perfect!"
23,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great buy really comfortable to wear and keeps me cool

33,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice for winter. These are very nice and warm.  It washed up very nie and is just perfect.  The fit was very comfortable.
34,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable I bought these to workout in and purchased a size up. I usually wear a small, but didn't want something too tight so I ordered the medium. I love the way they fit. I don't get too sweaty and can really move comfortably."
35,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Quality...
36,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Would purchase another loved Love the color
37,5,B0928FSGGD,1,I was very happy over all I would recommend<br />Them
38,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Would buy again! Squat proof color and comfort is amazing! Not extremely moisture wicking but does help somewhat. I do sweat a lot when working out.
39,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good quality and good fit Material is of decent thickness.  This brand runs a little larger than Hanes and some other brands, but the fit, at least for me, is perfect.  Stitching is good as well.  Did not shrink much after washing."
40,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars it's nice
41,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,As described Does as described. Quality is very good
42,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great shirts Was looking for what I used to call “under armor” shirts.  These were exactly what I wanted.  Medium was tight like I wanted them to be under a shirt, but not uncomfortably tight.  I usually wear a M shirt and these followed."
43,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice shirt if you order a size larger than normal I ordered a size up from my normal size and the fit is perfect. There is just enough compression to decrease my man boobs, yet comfortable and long enough to enjoy it."
44,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice Looking This shirt fit my 6'1"" husband perfectly."
45,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,As Pictured! Super Soft! Just the right size that I needed. The color is as pictured. Perfect for the Fall season!

47,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,Just what I wanted Great buy!  Nice fabric and fit
48,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great dupe! Comfy and flattering! These leggings are amazing!! Such a great dupe for Gymshark Vital Seamless. They have some stretch but also are compressive enough to help with tummy control. I have received many complements while wearing these leggings. They are just barely sheer but that might be because I got the light gray. Love these for working out as they are sweat wicking and super cute!
49,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,I've bought 2 sets already for my son. He loves the look and feel of the top. Like the way it fits and it's breathable material
50,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Good Fit Good quality and durable.
51,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Great shirt Great shirt for the price! I bought a size small. I’m 5’8 150lbs. The only problem I’ve had is the the different fabrics between colors. I bought this in black and light gray. The black is soft and flattering. The light gray isn’t really soft and does not lay right. I love the black I wear I wear it all the time.
52,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Arrived on time Good
53,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Color as shown in the picture A beautiful sweatshirt, color was as indicated. I returned it because of the size. I will buy future products from this vender."

59,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Everything was great. I'm 5'4"" and the large was the perfect ... Everything was great.  I'm 5'4&#34; and the large was the perfect length for me, but it does not touch the ground (the picture shown gave me the impression it might).  Fabric is soft and I love the adjustable straps."
60,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Fits well Fits well. Worth the money
61,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Washes and wears beautifully. My daughter is tall for her age Daughter loves this dress...So colorful...She wears it often.. Washes and wears beautifully.  My daughter is tall for her age... Would have ordered the pants to go with it (since it's more of a skater skirt length with her height.). She currently wears leggings with it... Would recommend Jxstar matching leggings ... Would be adorable together. That will be my next purchase.
62,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Shirts fit fairly well except for around the hip area. Run rather small Runs small around hip
63,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Odd Reviews I am shocked at some of the reviews for these sweatpants. I have been buying them since 2019.  I work from home and LIVE in these.  I have at least 6 pairs, having worn a couple out(1-2) in 4 years is not bad. I did recently buy a pair with pockets. My others did not have pockets.  I am returning the pocket pair as they tore by the pocket. I will say the material was thinner than the non pockets.  I will continue to buy the non pockets style for as long as these are available.  I am 5’6 and 170 lbs.  I wear a 10-12 in jeans/pants and I get the XL for great comfort.  The large fits and is not skin tight but I prefer the XL.  Hope this helps clear up some of the negative reviews.  Oh and one person says you can’t machine wash and dry.  Yes you can. I have for 4 years."
64,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great tank I bought these as a base layer for some thinner, more see-through tanks that I have and love them so much that I want to get a few more to wear under work blouses as a cami."
65,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Overall, great tanktop. Sheer/Snug Fit. Ridiculously long review for anyone who reads them before buying....Love love love the cut, very open in the back/arms, high neckline but not so much that chokes me. Thin but good quality fabric. It is slightly see through, but not to the point where i wouldnt wear it to the gym. It did look thicker material in pictures, which is why i only gave 4 stars.<br />I am 5'3 and 185lbs, 38C bra size, with a muscular build that i let go of about 2 years ago and then had kids. Lots of leg muscle, holding most of my fat in my back and stomach. I got the Large, and it DOES fit, but not as loose as i would like. It isnt formfitting by any means, but i like my workout clothes extremely loose. Its also not long, goes right to the pant-line. Its longer in the front, but the back didn't cover my butt at all.<br />Ill be get getting an Xlarge and im sure itll be perfect."
66,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great for work and working out Great fits
67,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Love this top Love this top, and have gotten so many compliments on it! I did go up a size, just because I don’t like things to be fitted on me, and it fit perfect. Will be ordering more!"
68,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great woman's undershirt. I am a 5'6&#34; woman, usually wear a size 8/10. I ordered Medium, intending to wear these as undershirts under sheer tops. They are perfect. Offer a bit of support without being too tight."
69,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Perfect Perfect
70,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfortable These are the most comfortable sweatpants I have had in a long time!
71,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Form fittingl Really like the shirts.
72,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Sweatshirt, purple It’s very nice beautiful coloring and very comfortable"
73,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Comfy but the shirts roll up while running Great fabric and fit. Not great while working out. The shirt kept rolling up from the bottom.<br />Disappointed.
74,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Perfect fit Love them. Super comfortable. Thick material
75,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Comfortable & breathable I am 5'6, 120 lbs, size 26 waist and ordered a size small. They fit perfectly! The color is a little lighter than it is in the photo. The thick waist band mimics more expensive yoga pants and makes them extremely comfortable. These quickly became one of my favorite pairs of yoga pants and I will definitely be ordering more!"
76,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars It's a little baggy for a small but i like it.
77,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great product and arrived when expected. Great product and arrived when expected.
78,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great product This product is extremely awesome for my workouts. Its thin enough to feel cool and thick enough so that it doesn't leave sweat pools on the benches. The hoodie adds more comfort for the head when laying down.
79,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Perfection They are exactly what I was looking for. Incredibly soft, perfect amount of stretch, and flattering. I am 5’5” and weigh 135. I typically swing between small and medium depending on the brand. I went with a small and they fit perfect. No muffin top and the length is great. Will be buying more!!"
80,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"BEST LEGGINGS EVER!!! I bought 4 sets with matching sports bras!  Can't get over how comfortable and cute these are!  They even breathe well during cardio when I tend to heat up the most.  Wish they had a pocket, but then they wouldn't be ""seamless"".  Love em."
81,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"great leggings, amazing customer service I ordered a pair of these last week and they were AMAZING. So amazing I ordered another pair a few days later. I just got those in and they fit completely different and the material felt different. I was very disappointed. Especially because I had recommended them to a lot of people and it seems they are inconsistent.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW: after I wrote this review I was contacted directly by the seller apologizing for the inconsistency. She had told me that the second pair I got was in fact a different material that the first pair. She offered to send me a free pair of leggings that were the material of my first pair. I was shocked with the customer service I received. she was very prompt to replying and definitely wanted me to be satisfied. I am very happy!"

92,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Better than Commercialized Name Brand Quality is perfect for the price & you get 3. Rather buy this brand than any commercialized one Reebok Nike Adidas etc. I'm 5'9 weighing about 190lbs and bought a large which fits just right.

95,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"3 months wearing this. Size M 5’7 at 175lbs size M for all 6 I got. These shirts are awesome! They show every muscle when you look at your self in the mirror.  I got 6 of these 3 months ago and they haven’t been ruin. I wash them every week to be used for next week. 3 months ago I had a bigger belly so it was a bit tight around the waist, so if you have a big belly get a bigger size. The length is not to long and not to short. It goes just below a belt for reference at least for me."
96,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Very nice fit Fit as expected.  They are really nice and comfortable for working out.

It still looks really nice and is very pretty.  Not a stretchy fabric, more of a lightweight poly blend.  Good quality too!"
99,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,BUY THE PANTS! I absolutely LOVE these gym pants! Perfect fit. I’m 5’2 at 125lbs and I ordered a size small.

113,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Super cute These leggings are amazing for the price. I’m 5’5 150lb & I got the M in black and grey and they’re lovely. Not squat proof but I don’t do a lot of squaring at the gym so I don’t mind it. 9/10. Can’t beat this style and quality for the price.<br />Please excuse me standing in the bed.

130,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"TOTALLY worth it! a lot of times, leggings might not fit right - either they're too short or they're so tight that they tend to ride down. These are thicker, but soft, fit exactly how I wanted them too, are high waisted, super cute, make my butt look BANGIN, and I will probably buy more pairs in more colors. great find for amazon leggings."
131,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,I recommend them Good shirts I would buy more and good product
132,4,B076QD9NP1,1,"Perfect for the rainbow/kitty lover! I think this dress is very cute. My daughter loved it. The fabric is silky not scratchy and has a nice twirl when spinning. It's perfect for a rainbow/kitty lover. As for the fit. I went with her true size and it does fit well. It's a little short, but my girl is taller than average. If I would have sized up it would have gaped around the arms. I will buy again if available when she grows out of it and will be going back to look at their other available merchandise."
133,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,soft and comfy I absolutely love this pants. They are soft and are very comfortable. I bought them because I wanted something light for my Zumba class- it fits perfect and the material is not too thick.<br />I already ordered a second pair.

I am 5’2 120 pounds and wear a size 2. I got a small and they fit perfect. My only problem was that I ordered certain colors and they gave me the wrong ones."
136,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"The more-or-less 15th Popyoung dress I have bought this summer I discovered the Popyoung dresses in about May of this year, bought one and liked it, bought another and liked it, etc.  The dresses are comfortable and easy to launder; also, they draw lots of compliments. I chose Popyoung in the first place partly because the dresses are rayon, not polyester, and partly because whoever designs their fabrics has a taste that very much matches mine. I bought the above long-sleeve dress and several others because  we have very short summers here, and I'm now stocking up for winter."
137,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great hoodi I like it alot

154,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Love 'Em These are my favorite workout tops. I bought another pack.
155,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,FLEX Love these shirts
156,5,B09M6X79V9,1,so comfortable These are so soft and comfy. I wear them everyday. I wear the medium because I like a compression fit. Best part is they don't ride up in the front or the back.
157,5,B09M6X79V9,1,I would recommend this product. I love it.
158,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Its nice Its a little bit smaller than expected. But, still fits well."
159,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comforable This sweatshirt was warm and comfortable.  Hopefully it'll last a few years.  I'll try and do a follow-up review later.

161,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Very soft and comfortable. Very comfortable I would like to get more in other colors

163,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"A real Winner! It was a present, and she loved it."
164,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Fits pretty good. I wear an XL and chest is a little tight when working out. Not much, but a little. Fits pretty good. I wear an XL and chest is a little tight when working out."
165,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"The flex style is awesome!! *UPDATE*<br />After I submitted my review, the seller contacted me and was very apologetic about my experience with the leggings I ordered. They suggested the Flex style which was more squat proof, asked me which color I wanted and sent me a pair at no charge.<br /><br />They sent me the khaki green flex style leggings in Small (I’m 5’4”, 135-140lbs). They fit perfectly, were completely squat proof, and they didn’t slide down at all. I do have a camel toe with them but I generally wear longer shirts so that’s not much of an issue for me.<br /><br />I’ll definitely be getting the charcoal flex style soon and I hope they come out with more colors! The 5 star review refers to the Flex style, not the others. I didn’t have great luck with the other styles so I really hope they give more colors in the flex style besides charcoal, green, and pink (because I don’t do pink 😂).<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Not squat proof, even though I got the proper size. I also had a pretty major camel toe, and they slipped down.<br /><br />I’m glad they worked so well for others, but they just didn’t work for me. Returned them."
166,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Buen producto Muy buen producto , muy cómodo"
167,5,B09M6X79V9,1,True to size I like these
168,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great product Great shirts.  Based on reviews that they run a little big, I ordered a medium (usually large) and it fit perfectly.  I would have loved these to be a little longer but honestly I love them."
169,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Have had Russel before & they last forever. Like it. very nice. Soft
170,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Great quality Heavy sweater, prefect and cozy. Best purchase."
171,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Perfect fit Fits perfect and wash nicely
172,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great fit and quality. Worth the price! My husband ordered these for me and they are great quality for a great price. Pretty true to size-- I am 5'8, 130 lbs and I got a medium. I usually fall between a medium and small, I'm glad I got the medium for some extra comfort. No digging, no rolling down, no stretching out. So far these are great and I will definitely order more."
173,5,B009R09Z8W,1,💗 My daughter loves this sweatshirt - soft material and beautiful color !
174,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Love wearing these as undershirts.
175,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good
176,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Love the bright color I dont mind it being too big I like my sweatshirts big, rather than too small."
177,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Look at sizing chart, fits according to that! Make sure you look at the chart. I usually wear a large-xlarge and I bought a 2X based on measurements and they fit great. I really wish they sold V-neck compression because I'd buy even more of those!"
178,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,Size up I wanted to like these but they fit more like leggings and I was looking for more of a jogger style. I would suggest sizing up and then they would probably work unless the waist would be too big.  Haven't tried it.  I just ended up returning. The material is light and feels nice.  The quality for the price point is great.
179,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Made well, runs small Very well made, just runs a bit small, which is fine if you wear it as a base. Buy up a size or two if you don't want skin-tight. Have washed and dried numerous times without issue."
180,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Material is soft and comfortable Fit and quality exceptional!  I will buy more.
181,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Very nice product Nicely form fitting. Soft and pleasant material.

184,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"True to size This material is great for going to the gym, hiking or whatever strenuous activity you might have in mind. Its dries quickly and is light on the body. You won't feel like it's suffocating you."
185,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Love love love this dress Nice dress fits perfectly,  will order again"
186,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"The same Russell Quality I have loved I had a grey Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Full-Zip Fleece Hoodie for many years and loved it.  Eventually, after many many years of use, it was getting worn, so I decided to replace it. This turned out to be easier said than done.  The company said that they didn't have stock in the summer when I first tried to replace it and I needed they said to wait until cold weather for them to have new stock. They suggested Amazon but AMazon he no stock either at that time.<br /><br />I was also kind of worried since several reviews on the Russell site and on Amazon had complaints from purchasers claiming that the sizes were too large or too small, and it was mentioned that they were made somewhere new ... I forget where.... perhaps in Asia or England someplace.  My original hoodie sweatshirt was made in Mexico.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to purchase some more ""XL Pro Cotton"" T-Shirts which I have had for years, but Russell advised they had discontinued this type of T-Shirt, which was heavy-weight cotton and had a pocket on the upper left breast area.<br /><br />So when cold weather returned, I tried to order a replacement for my Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Full-Zip Fleece Hoodie, but the Russell company had only Grey and Blue and I had decided I wanted to try black this time. So I tried Amazon again, and Jackpot Amazon did have it in Black.  I was still worried about the size based on the reviews last year, but I ordered XXL anyway as I had before, and it fits perfectly ... just like the old one.<br /><br />This new one is made in Honduras it says rather than Asia or England or wherever<br />the ones people complained about the size said theirs was made, and this one is 50% Cotton and 50% Polyester just like my old one was. I couldn't be more satisfied."
187,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"For short arms only Nice shirts and colors, but the sleeves are too short for long arms like mine. Nicely fitted and flattering but I wish the sleeves were a bit longer."
188,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,No slip or falling! These legging are so amazing I just bought another pair! The material feels high quality and I love the thick band. They didn’t fall down while working out
189,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Sleeves area bit short for standard sized body frame. Nice fit and feel.  The sleeves are on the shorter side.  Overall good quality.

195,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great undershirt My son loves these. I ordered down one size as suggested by some reviews, but they're a little short on him. I will order another set that is true to size for him."
196,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love it! Perfectly fit, affordable and nice fabric."
197,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Will buy again Excellent fit, highly recommend!"

206,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Gift She loved them
207,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Work well but run small These run very small. I normally wear a medium to large depending on brand. Based on the size chart, I ordered a XL and they are still very tight, especially under the armpits. I bought them to wear under my scrubs during winter months. They are working well for me, but I do recommend ordering a larger size for comfort."
208,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sweatshirt Nice weight to this sweatshirt
209,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I live in these things... Just what I expected -- of course, I've bought them and loved them before, so I knew what to expect. Basically, I live in these things :-)"

Will be ordering different colors. These are NOT junk, I would compare them to any $60-$70 dollar pair. Highly recommend. Order your regular size."
217,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good quality and fit as expected!!
218,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"but like I mentioned After reading the reviews, I was careful about the ordering the correct size for my son. They definitely were not as tight as he expected, so I'm sending them back and ordering a small.<br /><br />Just a note: he had surgery and needed a compression shirt, but like I  mentioned, it was not as tight as it should have been.<br />He did say there was a bit of compression but nothing great. Only 4 stars for this because of sizing."
219,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Just as good as the other products I've purchased from Neleus I decided to buy this three pack of muscle tanks with a hoodie because one of my friends sweats a lot. Nothing is worse than having someone else's sweat on the back of your head. In a way, this purchase was more for my friend than me. This is also the fourth time I've purchased clothing from Neleus. I hope this brand continues to grow because the deals they give can't be beat."

226,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Good Deal Great price for the quality, I just wish they had the thumb cutouts. I ordered medium. I'm 5'1, 135 pounds and wear a 34 D. They fit great. Length is good to but rides up a little when your doing vigorous exercise."
227,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Efficient shipping, product was as pictured. Excellent product."
228,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Well made hoodie This hoodie is well made, comfortable and looks great. Always been a fan of Russell products. Great products and good value."

235,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Get smaller size if you want more compression Nice for the money got 3xl should have got 2xl
236,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Great buy! Bought these shirts to wear under my short-sleeved work shirt and I’m very pleased so far! They are super comfortable and the material never made me feel too hot or cramped. The shirts were so comfortable at work that I wore them again in my days off.<br /><br />Only note: a lot of reviews said to order a size up. I’m a small normally and ordered a medium. I wish a had gotten them in a small, but that’s because I wanted them to fit really right under my other shirts. If you don’t mind a looser fit, I’m sure a size up will work."
237,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"This is my favorite hoodie of all time This is my favorite hoodie of all time. I wear it as often as possible. The hood is a little snug, but that's fine with me. I wish there was a slightly lighter-weight one so I could wear it during the spring months."
238,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars But it's okay

242,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"I like this dress I bought this dress hoping it would match some leggings I have but they didn't match. However, I like the dress and have even received lots of compliments. It is comfortable, too!"
243,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"So far so good, it appears to be well made So far so good, it appears to be well made.  The real test will be after it has been washed a couple times.  I bought because of the Russell brand.  Years ago it was a well respected brand. Hope it still is."
244,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits great Mesh sticks to velcro
245,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Very comfortable and feels very well made.
246,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Would buy another one. These are great for working out. Stretch enough to me comfortable and also tight enough to keep everything in place. I ordered size L even tho I’m usually a size M. I feel like these will fit me way after losing al the weight I will. They seem to be good quality fabric.
247,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Shirts Shirts fit as they should.
248,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Perfect for layering under clothes. Fit as expected.
249,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,The fit was perfect for me The fit was perfect for me.  Wish they were a little longer in length on hips but other than that I'm very happy.

251,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Supper cute 🥰 Love the way it fits. Supper comfortable!
252,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect Shirt Great quality and fit.  I don't understand some of the reviews that mention pills.  I've never seen any, and don't understand how this type of shirt could even produce pills."
253,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great buy! Very warm,comfortable,and reasonably priced. Runs somewhat big,but not bulky...I love it!"
254,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great price and comfort! Love these. They are snug and cozy.
255,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,So nice! I have never owned a vital seamless legging and this is my first time purchasing one from Aoxjox. I heard good things about this new version and I can say it definitely feels nice. I’ve always wanted one from gymshark but never got the chance so I can’t compare these but man they sure do fit good! I got the black and gray in small (my usual size in leggings). I would recommend sticking to your usual size as well.
256,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great buy! Purchased six at the beginning of the summer and I’ve been wearing them every day!
257,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable and soft Love the fit, feel and comfort, but like all the others, it rides up. Ah, well, none are perfect."
258,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Perfect for WLS patients I’m a weight loss patient and hate wear the tummy bands, do I got this hoping it would hold everything in and just be comfortable. Honestly it’s perfect and I highly recommend"
259,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"This product delivers! Very pleased with the quality of this hoody. The size was exactly as I expected and the thickness of the material is suprisingly good. I think it will keep me warm when needed, but it's light enough that you don't feel you're wearing a coat. It's not inexpensive, but it's also not cheaply made."
260,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love the fit and style Love the fit and style. I wasn’t a fan of the print or how sheer it was, so I returned it."
261,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great I really like it ! It’s shorter in the front then the back. That’s perfect for me because I’m not very tall,Some of the other dresses I’ve gotten off of Amazon are so long I have to tie a knot to be able to wear them without tripping."
262,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Favorite joggers I loved them so much I bought 2!
263,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Cute summer dress I love the way it fits !!!
264,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"love it It fits as expected, and it's perfect for working out!"
265,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Just right
266,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Good quality- stretchier than Gymshark, not a perfect match for the Aoxjox Vital charcoal top Love the product. I can tell a small difference between these and Gymshark vital in that these seem to have a little more stretch. I also purchased the Aoxjox Vital long sleeve top, hoping that even though the colors appear slightly different on the Amazon pics they would make a match. There is a slight color variation (the top has a slightly darker shade of charcoal marl), it's still close enough for me :)<br />Love the price point!"
267,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Size up Normally i’m a medium, but after reading the reviews and not wanting to wear these super tight, i got them in XL, and i love them. As a PE teacher, these are heaven sent !"
268,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Great fit,good quality, now have 2"
269,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Perfect layer under my work shirt Good fit, I needed something under my work shirt that was thin and breathable but added a little warmth when the fans are blowing."
270,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,I like It fit perfectly just little short side
271,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Nice dress. Adorable!  Fit is perfect.  I bought the 5/6 and it fits my granddaughter like it was made for her - she is 42&#34; tall and about 38 lbs. The dress is polyester so not the normal cotton dress, but it swings nicely and my granddaughter says feels great!"
272,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Will be buying more! Super cute! Also SQUAT PROOF. I am 5”1 and about 155 pounds. The color is amazing and the design on them is very flattering. Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because I wish they were more compressive in general since I like a more put together feel but they are comfortable, and the light material seems breathable. The length isn’t too long for my short little legs considering I ordered a large."
273,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Flattering Flattering, sexy but not too sexy, comfortable, quality."
274,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars a great present for Christmans

277,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love These Pants!! I love these pants. They are so comfortable and fit true to size. I ordered a size large and they are tight where they’re supposed to be and loose everywhere else. I will be buying more :)
278,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Great tank tops It isn't as compression as I would like but I do like the material and the fit of these.
279,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Good Quality Hoodie! Not as bright as the photo but I much rather like it that way. Its very good quality for the price! Would recommend
280,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Perfect
281,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Pleasantly surprised!! Love this dress
282,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great fit Swimmer’s build here , maybe a little bulkier and the tank fits great. I think the cut is one of the best/sexiest muscle tanks I’ve ever bought. It’s also extremely breathable making cardio day a little more bearable lol"
283,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Fits Perfectly Great product for price.  Will be a great summer addition to my wardrobe.
284,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good quality budget hoodie Good quality budget hoodie.  Worth the money for sure.  Make sure to wash before you wear or risk getting fuzzies all over yourself.

290,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great dress Love the material
291,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love it Great lightweight jacket for those Fall days or night. Bought 2x cause I like the jacket to be looser.  Definitely 1x would have been a bit tighter than I would have wanted. Think they run a tad small. Navy is the darker blue that I wanted.
292,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great! Awesome product !
293,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,When your order is what you expected Fitted exactly like I expected it!
294,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great buy! Love these have ordered two sets. Comfortable for hot weather. Workout or wear out to back yard BBQ.
295,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Nicely made and true to size Color was more orange than red but it’s so cute and fit so well I kept it.
296,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Very comfortable I have worn the three shirts and they were amazing. I wore one shirt under a thin dress blouse and it was very comfortable.I have worn the other two with jeans.  I will order another set so I will,have  one for each day.  I did order an extra large because it was form fitting.  I initially ordered the shirts for compression,but I am pleased even though they are not as compressed as I wanted them to be."
297,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Quality, but be careful about the size I got an XL size, but found it to be more like a XXL size.  I am planning to wash it in HOT water and and a full dryer cycle to try to shrink it.<br /><br />As for the quality of the product, it is a good heavy weight shirt. I would buy it again if I can figure out how to get the right size."
298,5,B07XD71F1H,1,". Love this dress..only thing I would recommend is ware the same color undergarments , u can tell if u don't.."

303,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Comfortable Bought normal size and the light compression feels great. We wash on delicate, cold water and hang dry. 5 months in and they are holding up great and I wear one every day. We've purchased 9 of these total. Very happy with this purchase."
304,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Fits good! Its true to size and good fabric.<br />Feels good to work out in.<br />I dont know how they hold up after a couple of washes though
305,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Perfect! These are perfect when leggings aren’t appropriate and sweats are too casual.  They don’t provide any warmth, but are so comfortable & flattering."
306,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Better than expected! The three pack is a great deal. Fit is great. I wore one on a run recently. It’s my favorite new running shirt. The hood is a good bonus. I just use it for sweat post run. It’s thin, so it’s for indoor workouts or good weather."
307,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,nice great
308,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great find! Super comfy and the material is soft. Perfect for casual or night out.
309,5,B07XD71F1H,1,I love my dress! It was perfect for.my costume! And cute enough to wear on a regular da ay!
310,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Love them! I’m 5’7 and a size 14, with a bit of a thicker butt and I got a size XL. They fit great, don’t roll when I sit and they make my butt look good(lol). They do collect lint because of the material but a basic lint roller should help with that."
311,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good Good
312,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Exactly as Expected Very comfortable and the size was perfect. The colour is accurate to the image on the listing. I plan to turn this one into a Superman sweater.
313,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Breathable Ordered for my son for football camp... he sweats really bad and I didn't want him to get overheated....now it's all he wears
314,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"One of the nicest I've tried Give me some time to wear this regularly and I'll have a better opinion of it, and may ramp it up one more starc-- however, it runs TRUE to size, fits like a glove, is lightweight and compresses gently. Does it ride up? Too early to tell - wait until it has some wear and some washings.<br />Price is GREAT -- 3 in a bundle --"
315,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Comfortable I love it
316,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Looks and feels great It doesn't hug the body and it's not too loose, I got large as 6ish' currently 195ishlb halfway between athletic and normal build if that makes any sense. Warmer than a tank top but comfortable, recommend for working out and for running."
317,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell Athletic Men's Dri-Power Crewneck Fleece Sweater Very nice quality. Husband wears these for work, they wear well and fit well."
318,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,size fits comfortable

322,4,B07XD71F1H,1,The day it will arrive. The dress looked beautiful on my daughter.
323,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,If you want it snug Nice undershirt outside of it being slightly larger than I would have liked. I will go a size smaller if I order these again.
324,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Back racer shirts Very light weight and breathable when wearing during a run or workout at the gym
325,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"great fit For some reason I got away from purchasing Russell sweats. Mistake on my part, this shirt became a favorite immediately."
326,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,get this love thisssssss

329,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Comfortable My back has never looked better.
330,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Cute! Definitely love these leggings! I’m someone w/ big hips and thighs (49.5 in.) so I thought these wouldn’t work for me but they do! I bought it in one of the bigger sizes (L or XL) and it’s not sheer at all! Cute for working out or just simple athletic attire. Made my sister want to order some 😂 (may post pics later when I wear them again)
331,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Very comfortable Product is perfect. Very comfortable
332,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,I really dig it! I really like this hoodie. I just wish It didn’t have those lines that go across of it.
333,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Nice fleece
334,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"High Quality, Excellent Value This is my first garment made by Russel Athletic, and judging by its quality and value it won't be my last.  Well made, holds its shape, well proportioned, washed up beautifully without noticeable shrinkage.  Based on this experience I'll probably seek out RA products for future purchases."
335,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Got so many compliments it’s insane I love this product. Worth every dollar
336,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfy Lightweight warm.
337,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Good fit, but kind of cheap Upon opening the package these leggings looked wayyy to small. However after trying them on the stretched to fit me. They fall just a little above the ankle (which is how I like my leggings) so I’m happy with the fit. There was a loose string on one of the seams however. Also, the product had fuzz all over it initially, but it can easily be shaken off."
338,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,CAN'T BEAT THE RUSSELL BRAND! Great fit and very comfortable!
339,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Good product Great quality and very soft, you done even feel it on. Great quality product and recommended. Will definitely buy again"

345,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Nice Hoodie Good Quality
346,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Definitely not shape wear They're not so much compression but they definitely work as undershirts or a shirt just to go under a button up or something like that very cute!
347,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love these leggings!!! I love how these leggings make me feel. They hug you in all the right places that really allows you to show off all the hard work you’ve been putting in a the gym! Great purchase. Love. Will buy again for sure.

354,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Order small for better compression I buy this kind of shirt for compression when working out and moisture wicking when hiking in hot weather.<br />It seems to help keep heat in during colder weather.<br />I'm 6' 2"" and nearly 200 lbs.  I bought a smallso that it has a tight fit.  It's comfortable and plenty long."
355,5,B09M6X79V9,1,I love these tips for the price they are I love these tops for the price they are. Have not had any issues and have already washed them. I don’t dry them though but i never dry my work out attire. They are super cute!

359,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Solid quality product at price point A workout buddy suggested these to me, and I have to say he was right. I went with XL as buddy mentioned they fit a bit tight, and it is perfect. I am 5'11"" x 180lbs - workout quite a bit. I feel the fit at the chest, but it isn't bad or uncomfortable. Hood is great for running in a drizzle. The 3 pack at this cost can't be beat."
360,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,I love everything about these Love everything about theses joggers!  Great quality for the price!!!
361,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Solid Choice for a Sweat Shirt I like the material ... comfortable and heavy.
362,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Comfy, Fun! I love this dress.  I usually wear medium,  but exchanged for a small.  Either works but less loose material in the waste area.  I'm 5'6 142#. Very flattering, comfortable,  already bought it in 2 more colors!"
363,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Best in class Love these. Well made, hold up to repeated washing, and remain comfortable all day."
364,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"the big size actually fits big guys I like the product thus far. The material us light weight and a bit strectchy. True show off shirt. I am 6'2"" 325lbs.  Not the biggest bear in the woods. My waist is 43-42 in and hangs nicely. Chest is about 55 inches. If need some development get it first truly designed to advertise the chest shoulders and arms.  I will have pics coming soon.<br /><br />I finally took pics. I still live the shirts."

375,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great shirts I am female and love to wear these men's shirts around the house with sweatpants.  I have more than one color, and they are so comfortable.  They wash and dry perfectly and last a long time.  I would definitely recommend them."
376,5,B097RFTKJP,1,So cute and flattering I love it! Very flattering shape. I also love  dresses/tops that I can get away without wearing a bra and this is definitely one.
377,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Exactamente lo que esperaba!!!. Muy buena calidad
378,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Fits small Runs small for the size chart. I usually wear a large and this fits like a medium.

382,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"Nice fabric This fits well, but is definitely clingy. Perhaps it’s because the material is thin or because it’s a bit silky, but it clings to any roll or bump, especially in the back."
383,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great quaility. This is my second hoodie from Russell Atheletic. I bought my first one in the 80's. Still have it and wear it.
384,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,love it give me more fit/tone body
385,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Four Stars These shirts have been great for working out! They don't soak with sweat and don't absorb smells either.

400,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfy - comfy! I LOVE these tanks. They fit great, they don't make you sweat, and they are very, very comfortable.  I am the type that wears a camisole under everything, and I always put these on before any of the other tanks I have.  I have washed them several times and they have retained their shape and quality.  I also put everything in the dryer so no worries that it's going to shrink or that the fabric is going to change."
401,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"These Are A Must Have Ordered these for my son as he likes to wear these as a change up to full undershirts. I like the black as well as the white. It’s nice to have both depending on what ur wearing. They are good to help with scratchy material, but u want to be cooler! I’m buying more!"
402,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Five Stars They are awesome +A
403,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Cute! Exactly what I thought I ordered, washed well, no pilling"
404,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Buy These Pants Now! These are an absolute must have! They are ridiculously comfortable and make your lower half look like a fitness model. I’m not even joking. They fit every curve perfectly and are so unbelievably flattering. I have purchased 3 pairs now. Lol Get these! You’ll thank yourself! I bought a medium but ended up returning for a large. The waist fit fine on the medium but I’m pear shaped, so I need a little more from in the thigh."
405,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Not bad Should have bought a smaller size.
406,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Exactly what i purchased!
407,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cute dress This is a cute dress and is decent material. I am exchanging it for a size larger though. I wear a size 12 and ordered a large, just a little to tight around my midsection where I carry extra weight, so I decided to go up to the XL because of that. But this is a good purchase for the money! I am  5'7"" and it hits just above the knee."
408,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,I'm usually a size 8/10 I love the pockets and the dress is super roomy and ... Noting the sizing I ordered an XL. I'm usually a size 8/10  I love the pockets and the dress is super roomy and flowy.

416,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Fits good.
417,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Smart new look Great new color!  I was getting tired of always wearing typical  men's colors day after day.  The purple will be a nice change of pace and make for a different look.  It's about time a company thinks outside the box and is willing to sell something the other companies do not.
418,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I love them, now I want the blue one. they're better than my Champion hoodies love how they fit happy they arrived at said time I will be ordering the blue hoodie in my next order"

424,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Good product for the price
425,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Cute but clingy I really like this dress.  I first bought a small and it was too small so I bought a medium.  It fits but I think its the material. I am not curvy, kinda boxy. I think it would look better on someone with curves. It does cling to the body but does have some stretch. I'm 5'-4"", 130lbs."
426,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"GREAT JACKET I USE IT TO GO TO THE GYM IN COLD DAYS,  AND FOR ME WORKS FINE. THE JACKET HAS EXCELLENT QUALITY."

429,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"SO COMFY I bought this sweater for my boyfriend near winter because his entire closet is just Hawaiian shirts and he was annoying me by always telling me it was cold.<br /><br />For reference, my boyfriend is 5’9 and roughly 140 lbs. I could have purchased the size small and it would have fit him perfectly (like a normal shirt). However, I wanted to get him something super comfy and oversized so I purchased a size medium and it is perfect. It hangs loose in all the right places but doesn’t fall off him (and I can steal it when I get cold! Win-win)"
430,4,B097RFTKJP,1,Great dress The tie is in the front not like picture but cute and comfy

438,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Read product info for correct sizing Liked the material.  I use it for spin class
439,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Good basic workout shirts Everything I was expecting. Wicks away sweat and keeps you cool. Been walking/running in 80 degree whether and haven’t felt the need to switch to a short sleeve. They do ride up but if you where high waisted leggings it isn’t a big deal as most compression shirts ride up during runs
440,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Quality Product I really like this product, it is good quality and I wish I would of bought two of them."
441,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Can't beat price and quality For the price of a 3 pack, the quality is surprisingly nice and breathable material. Have used for several weeks now and really enjoying it, super light and comfortable for the gym. Will buy more in the future, 5 stars!"
442,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Looks exactly like online photo. I Love it. I bought it for a special occassion. It is so much more than I expected. Looks exactly on me as it did in the online photo. I am going to get at least one more.
443,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Ok for cheaper workout gear Ordered like other reviews stated, I got the largest size available for a great fit and great price. I got these to take to Costa Rica want to have as many barriers against mosquitos as possible."

461,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great product: similar to Zyia joggers Fit true to size. They are super comfortable. The band is amazing and stays in place. Can dress up for work or wear for working out. These are similar to the peak joggers from Zyia.

I ordered the large because I wanted lots of airy space in my dress, I usually wear 6-8 and the Medium would probably have fit fine. I love pockets, and polka dots. I've worn this dress once and recieved multiple complements. Its comfortable and very cute."

470,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Good value Great leggings for the price. Very stretchy and confortable.
471,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love Absolutely love this dress. Very comfortable and still flattering despite being a flowy style
472,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great pants These are amazing!! They are lightweight, comfortable, and true to size!!"
473,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good sweat shirt Had one for years just got old and worn out
474,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Tremendous Value I work out in these shirts every day.  I am a big Under Armour fan but these are a super quality and very lightweight. Really pleased.
475,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Perfect for Travel! This summer I'm flying on a red-eye from Chicago to the U.K. for a Cruise. (So glad!) I've read that joggers are the perfect pants for long distance flights. I normally don't wear them. They've always look too sporty or too snug. Never found the right ones, I guess, until now. The black Oalka joggers arrived today. WOW! They're smooth, comfortable, and a perfect length (I'm 5'4"".) I love the cuffed ankles. The high, wide waist fits well over my elderly middle. There's some looseness in the thighs, but not too much. Can dress up or dress down. I believe they'll wash well by hand or on delicate in a machine. On the plane, I plan to wear them with a t-shirt, a blazer (as soon as I've found the right one), and my slip-on Sketchers. I'm so happy to have found these. Think I'll order a 2nd (or 3rd) pair!!!"
476,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Comodidad Excelente
477,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Good product
478,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Love it So cute, fits great"
479,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"5'8"" 150lbs I ordered medium for perfect fit These are my new favorite workout shirts.<br />I use them for running and HIT workouts. They are perfect for anything that involves sweating. I have in almost every color. The price is perfect for what you get and the fit is exactly what you expect. The material is thin, but I prefer that in an active shirt for breath-ability. It hangs low in the arm holes (obviously) but if you order the right size its not so much that the boobage hangs out. These shirts are perfect for anything gym and outdoor activity related!! I'm finding I really love this brand."
480,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very Nice and great price too. Very Nice and great price too.
481,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Another Amazon Prime Win 5'6&#34; 116lbs lopsided books one b and one dd.  That being said, it's not easy to find something that does not draw attention to this.  The dress is got is a size M.  The green is pretty and reminds me of Tinker bell.  The dots are a very pale green.  The dress is 100% cotton.  I live in Florida, it's HOT!  This dress is keeping me cool.  I even washed it prior to wearing and tossed it in the dryer.  It held up very well.  The only issue is on the left seem where it is a bit defective  (see pic).  Since I use Amazon Prime, I called and explained.  They offered a refund, but I wanted to keep it, so they refunded me partial.  Amazon prime rocks!"
482,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Great Simple Summer Dress with Style This fits a little snug on the chest but loosens up during the day. The length is perfect for my 5'1 , 180lb. frame. I bought a large. I love this summer dress so much that I bought it in blue as well."
483,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Fit just right Fit just right
484,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Awesome Awesome product and it’s very comfortable
485,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable, Soft and Durable Sweatshirts Unisex Fit We have several other sweatshirts, but we prefer these because they are soft, durable, colorfast and comfortable.  Fit is good for my husband and pleasingly roomy for me.  We can share the supply."
486,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Thinner material, hoping they were thicker For really nice, but the material is a little thin. More for summer"
487,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Just get them! If you’re thinking about getting them, do it.  For reference, I’m 5’1, 115-120lb, 32D, petite-muscular-idk-I’m active?, and got the XS. If you want more of a looser fit, maybe go a size up because this fits like a glove. I’m glad I went with the XS because my waist is short and these are a great length and fit.  They’re not “compressive,” but they’re very, very comfortable. I have tons of lululemon ss/ls swiftly (4-for snug fits, 6-for a bit of breathing room), but I just can’t justify spending $60 on a swiftly tank or power y, when there are other options - like this!! They have a little bit of shine to them, but not much at all, and I’ve included pics with flash to compare them with some of the lulu, as well as the black on black with Nike shorts, so I think the fabric is great! I would definitely wear these casually, and technically for workouts and yoga. These don’t have shelf bras, and while shelf bras are great for low impact (yoga, lifting, etc), I don’t ever feel like shelf bras are enough for HITs (running, jumping, etc), so these are perfect.  I haven’t washed them, but it feels like I could wash them with my other workout clothes and dry them on medium. It’s polyester and spandex so I don’t think it’ll shrink, and if it does I’ll update the post. Hope that helps!"
488,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great deal Great T-tops Fit and feels great fast delivery feels good while working out did not shrink after washing them looking forward to more tranactions would highly recommended<br />R-J-

Must have in every color, I don't wanna take this bundle of happiness off! I'm 145 lbs/5""5 tall and a small fits loose and flowy and hangs exceptionally well. Can jazz it up or keep it casual, adding a cardigan or a cropped leather jacket or even a jean jacket will make it transition into fall really well. The fabric is light but more on the opaque side, my man walked behind me and promised me he couldn't see my undies. I'll have to trust him on that. But overall, I really love this dress!"

I’m 5’4”  130lbs and I got a small. At first I thought they would be too small but they stretch and fit perfectly. Will be buying again in another color!
524,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Que es un buen producto Me gusto mucho porque la uso para correr y esta muy cómoda
525,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Love! Love these!!! I wear them under my scrub tops and I have another set I wear for working out. They are long enough without being weird and long enough that when they ride up- they don’t go far.
526,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,A great Jacket!!! Fit as expected. I had bought one of these years ago and it got ketchup spilled on it and i never could get the hugh stain out of it.. admittedly I was hesitant about ordering this on online.  But I love it and it fits great 👍 and its soo soft!!! As a matter of fact I'm ordering another one tonight from them!!!!
527,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Tight enough to be a second skin. Keeps you cool and dry! They keep you cool and dry and that’s what I wanted. I wear they work because I’m out side all day. They work well when going hiking.
528,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Comfortable. Bought for boyfriend.  He wears them every day. Has purchased additional sets. Different colors.
529,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Quality Russell makes a great hoodie. I have both pullover and zip hoodies from them, and their quality blows the others out of water. Yep, they're expensive, but I won't buy another brand for my hoodies. I will have to buy more, since my wife keeps stealing them. Apparently, she likes the Russell hoodies better, too."
530,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great fit and style Looks great and comfortable too. Will buy another one.
531,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Russell grey sweatshirt I do not like the brand tag at the neckline, so will cut it out. I really like the cotton feel of the fabric."
532,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good sweater
533,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Amazing look This white hoodie fits nicely. It's not to big or to small it is the perfect length. Great look and very comfortable to wear.
534,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Solid Fit with Comfort These were comfortable and soft. Fit as stated. Moveable and covered my back side. Does not rise as you move or better yet when you stretch. I love them for working out in. The material is of great quality. I only use them for working out. But wearing as an everyday top will not disappoint. 😁
535,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Hard to find color for a men's sweatshirt. Very good fit and comfortable. It will probably not last long because I will wear just about every day.
536,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Just right Arm pit holes a bit to large for shorter people. Otherwise, great hoodie"
537,4,B09M6X79V9,1,K All good. The fabric sticks to your skin firmly.
538,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Fits snug Bought it for under my shirt, for a 3 x it would be a bit big but it is really skin tight"
539,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Stop kidding yourselves with that price increase Bought a second Ash/Grey sweater because the first one fit so well and is so warm. But what the hell with the price increase??! The whole idea here is that the sweaters are warm and cheap, I even gave recognition of that in my first review. Luckily the color I wanted didn't have an increased price. The sleeves of the sweater are a little baggy, but nothing to hate. Good buy if you're a college student just looking to be warm in class."
540,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Exactly what I've want in a Gym Tank Fits great, feels great, looks great. I'm 5' 11"" 185lbs and Medium fits me perfectly. Makes me go harder at the gym."

545,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"fits small, but otherwise a good product, & no camel toe I usually wear a large in leggings, but I had to go up to extra large & even that is a bit tight. However, for the major feature I was looking for, a camel-toe free legging, these work great."
546,5,B09M6X79V9,1,it is as promised it is as promised
547,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good workout tank Fits well and dries fast so you don’t feel too sweaty.

563,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Hunting Hunting
564,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not a true compression tank, but still cute! I really like the quality of these tanks. They look like they’re perfect for working out in (I work out frequently). I didn’t buy them for that reason though. I just had surgery and bought them because I needed something tight around my abdomen. These tanks said they were compression, so I figured I’d give them a try. These tanks are not compression like advertised. Good quality? Yes. Perfect for working out? Yes. Form-fitting? Yes. Compression? Err, not so much."
565,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"it's very comfortable. We will buy this again as we will ... This is the first long sleeved Russell shirt we have bought. My husband only buys Russell T-s for yard work, casual wear and play. This brand is rugged and long lasting for the reasonable price. The long sleeve fit very well; it's very comfortable. We will buy this again as we will with the short sleeve Russells."
566,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Perfect undershirt I got these to wear under my uniform at work. I’m someone whose never comfortable. Always too hot or cold. But wearing these under my uniform is perfect (especially cause my uniform is short sleeved). I want it a bit tighter. When reading reviews I went 2 sizes up. I’m going to get more but this time I’ll prob go just 1 size up
567,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Very comfortable These are very comfortable and fit just right

569,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable The color and fit were great
570,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Fantastic base layer for Iceland I purchased these as vase layers for my summer trip to Iceland. They were wonderful and very comfortable. I have a 32H chest and these were not too tight or revealing. Plus having a traditional sleeve was helpful. I followed user recommendations and sized up for a looser fit and they were perfect!
571,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Attractive Shirt I bought it and really liked it, however for me it fit too tight around the underarms and I had to return it. The colors were exactly as displayed and the fabric was really nice and overall design flattering.  I'd would have loved to keep it."
572,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Nice Better than cotton under shirts
573,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,What's good Good
574,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Definitely size up! I usually wear medium but thought that large would be best in this fitted shirt. Wound up having to return it for an XL.
575,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,great just right
576,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Very comfortable Very comfortable, wish I brought this a long time ago. I just might buy another pack because there so comfortable"
577,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Little bit of pilling but I guess that’s normal? For a sweatshirt. Good quality. As pictured. My son likes to wear it all the time
578,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Best leggings ever I have a ton of leggings.  I wear a pair every single day.  These are the best,.most flattering, most comfortable leggings I've ever bought.  I wish I could replace.every pair with these.<br />I'm 5'7"", 150 lbs.  Medium is perfect."
579,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Body contouring I have tried several expensive brand name seamless leggings and they all seem to give go much slack or to little slack in the crotch area.. these leggings fit perfect! Hugs in all the right spots.. will be ordering more. I got a size medium, I'm 5'8 and 170lbs."
580,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Gym wear Great fit
581,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Very comfortable fit and feel
582,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Nice Its a good hoodie but wash it first before you wear it cause you will get ounk lint in your hair
583,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Wow! The Best Ever! I paid $16 for these so I had quite low expectations. Well they are possibly my best leggings yet! I own so many leggings including Lulus, Gym Shark, Nike, etc. These are absolutely squat proof and are super compressive, which I love! My favorite!❤️<br />I am 5’3, 160 lbs and use size 5 in pants. Medium fits great!"
584,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"I will buy more! Great fit but living in Florida, they can be too hot at times for me. I love them on other days!"
585,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars good
586,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Light Jacket Goes perfectly with the matching sweat pants.
587,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Slightly short for a 6ft guy but nice otherwise Wish they were a little longer but I really like them. Could also do without the white stitching style line. All black would be nicer
588,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Too Tight Great shirts, but they are too tight. Even an XL. Guess they run small."
589,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,bust sizes it s a dress !!
590,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great fitting sweatshirt Product arrived in a timely  manner
591,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars a replacement for the same item.  Clothes do wear out.
592,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Medium too small for me I am 5’6” and about 135 lbs.  The Medium was too tight, but I like my tanks to be a little loose.  These were skin tight.  Returning and ordered a Large. Hope the Large works"
593,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Very comfortable, tons of compliments! These have become my go to workout leggings. They are very comfortable and flattering. Some compression but not too tight. My only complaint is some colors are not squat proof. I have only had this issue with 2 colors out of the 6 i have tried so far which I just exchanged for a different color. Overall very pleased with these leggings."
594,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Shirt for working out Product fit and worked as was advertised would but it again.
595,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"I like this top! When i took it out of the pack I wasn't quite sure of about the top. But after trying them on, it was really a nice fit and very flattering to my shape."
596,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Amazing! Fits amazing! I have received many compliments
597,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Love it Love<br />It
598,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Very satisfied with this pair of sweatpants They are very comfortable and so soft
599,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Great comfortable hoodie Would’ve given the hoodie five stars? Except the print on the material at the elastic wristbands is not as thick as the rest of the hoodie.  If you stretch the wristband the pattern becomes white don’t know if it was a problem with this particular hoodie or that’s the problem with all the elastic wrist bands on Joe’s Hoodies .  Other than that a great hoodie. I guess since it’s camouflage just disappointing that the elastic wristbands are turning white in color.
600,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Mine Shirt is very cool and pretty colors
601,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Best Value Great for hiking is all weather.
602,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect Perfect 100 % Satisfied
603,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Just What I Needed! If you’re super indecisive about choosing between buying similar products on Amazon then just stop. I promise you this is the item you’re looking for. I bought mine and just got it today; the shirts fit perfectly and show off the back enough that it looks good but so that it also is comfortable. The material is breathable and not see through, I’m not sure why some shoppers said it was? Bottom line this is like less than $8 per shirt that would normally cost like $20-15 for just one individual shirt in the physical store suck as Dicks.<br /><br />I bought size small and I am 5’9’’ and weigh around 160 pounds. It fits well and isn’t too long. Be careful with the XS though, it might construct you in the armpits unless you actually need xs.<br /><br />I don’t give out very many five star reviews or ever feel compelled to write these PERIOD. However, I knew I had to when these literally blew my mind after I got them in the mail!<br /><br />Good job Neleus!"
604,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Four Stars I will prob get one size larger next time.
605,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfy but much too loose for compression Based on some of the reviews, I ordered up a size.. wish I hadn't."
606,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Five Stars I love this style and it fits perfect.
607,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Comfortable I bought this for a halloween costume so not much to say but it fit as expected and its pretty warm
608,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Replacement Shirt This Russell sweatshirt replaces a crew neck I've had for years and was showing a little ware. I must say the Russell quality has not changed, It's still first class."
609,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice material, great sleeve length Nice material, great sleeve length. I am a woman, but I buy mens, because womens' sleeve length is usually too short. Love this sweatshirt."

613,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Better than expected Pretty great sweatshirt!  The color is vivid, the fit is perfect (finally a Large that fits like a Large), and the quality is better than I would have expected for the price.  Mid to heavyweight fabric.  Certainly not too thin, and held its shape nicely after being washed (cold water, no dryer).<br />At this price, I would highly recommend."
614,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Buying More Immediately! I was quite sceptical when ordering these tights and I have large thighs and a smaller waist. When they first arrived I was scared because they looked TINY! But I LOVE these tights. I will immediately be ordering more. They make me look 10x more built than any other gym leggings I own. The fabric is lightweight but not thin or ""cheap"" at all. I got the green heather-coloured tights and you eventually could see sweat through them, but I am not too bothered about that kind of thing. I mean, you go to the gym to sweat right? I am ordering more right now!!"
615,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Happy with the product good quality Very happy with the product

627,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweatshirt for the price This is a nice soft sweatshirt.  I gave it a 4 due to the size. It fits like an X-large.  Also very long. I’d go a size down.
628,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,good stuff bought it in October still looks like new today
629,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Off brand polo Wearable
630,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Four Stars Fits really nice and I love that it is lightweight, flowy and fits loose. I especially love the Pockets.  I have purchased several dresses and have two of the black and white polka dot. Wear them all the time."
631,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good purchase 👌 My husband loves it!
632,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable compression tank Exactly what I was looking for.  Medium compression for under workout t-shirt but not too constricting, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  Washes well also!  Order a size smaller than you normally would.  I'm a XL/XXL generally and I ordered the US Large and it fits perfectly."
633,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Please fix the waist band and  I’ll buy all colors! Overall I like these pants, however if I could change three things about these pants this is what I would update on these:<br />1. the length (its wayyyyy to long), and<br />2. the waist “band”—— if it was thicker it would make all if us ladies who have had kids and have a little “pooch” look way more appealing, with these the band actually pushes the pooch down and makes it look even bigger. I’m 5’5” with a VERY athletic build, and I work out regularly, so my weight and fitness level are normal, I just am able to wear certain high wasted pants and look good and normal, these pants make me look like I could be pregnant! I would def spend more on pants with a high waste but thicker “compression” band to hold in that pooch or help hide it!<br />3. The color portrayed on these are wrong, look nothing like pictured, but I’m ok with it."
634,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Dad loved so much he bought 2 more! Dad loved it so much he bought 2 more
635,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"umm...POCKETS! the NICEST cotton..very thin, but not see-through. It may tear easily though..there's already been a rip in one of them. (you get what you pay for) I have purchased 3 of them so far and one for a friend. Super easy to wear, and is versatile, wear it up to go out or wear it down to go to the beach. And one more thing: POCKETS.  :)"
636,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Must get Looks really good and fits perfect for the gym
637,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable. Super comfy. Just what I was looking for.
638,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Not disappointed at all! I love these shirts, very comfortable fabric and fits like it should!"
639,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Awesome leggings Literally the best leggings I've ever tried on. I'm so picky and have returned a lot of leggings in the past but these are great. They fit perfect and the material is good.
640,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Men Sweatshirt Ordered XXL for husband his usual size, fits great.  Quality Nice, not cheap material.  Husband pleased with these sweatshirts."
641,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,I just loved the shirts they fit great thanks to all the ... I just loved the shirts they fit great thanks to all the reviews. I'm 5'5 and weigh 170 pounds I wanted for them to fit tight but comfortable at the same time I was unsure of the size but after reading reviews I decided to get medium and I'm glad I did !! I usually don't write reviews but once again the quality and product is amazing! Thinking of buying more.
642,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Very comfortable Very comfortable!
643,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Recommended Perfect for what I was looking for. I hate spending tons of cash on work out clothes because they ruin so easily, so these are v nice n cheap"
644,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,daily use wear these daily and super comfortable
645,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Muy buena calidad Los uso cuando hace un poco de calor
646,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Comfy & Lightweight These joggers are great! They’re extremely soft and stylish. Will be purchasing additional colors.
647,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Good material Was a little hesitant at first but it was amazing. Bought as a Christmas gift for a friend and he loved it! The purple was vibrant but soft
648,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice I have purchased two of these sweatshirts for my grandson.  He loves the color and the style.  Perfect weight for fall.
649,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Love love these I absolutely love these, I got a size smaller to help suck me in and it work, great quality material, I wear them under my tshirts"
650,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Love the way they fit I was worried about buying these since they’re not a popular brand, but my boyfriend loves them and asked for more."
651,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfect Great tops to show off your hardwork in the gym.  Very light weight, breathable and don’t hold sweaty smell."
652,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Beautiful Fit! This is the most unbelievable fit! Order true to size. It fits extremely well as a dress by itself or as a top over tights. It lays well over curvy areas. I love it!
653,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"I'm on the fence Thr material is very comfortable and rhe pockets are fabulous. BUT, I'm on the fence about these as a larger woman. I ordered my normal XXL size and they absolutely fit like leggings with pockets. Will probably keep them bit not loose fitting like I wanted."
654,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Husband is happy with them I bought these tanks for my husband to work out in.  He is 6 feet, 225 lbs. He normally wears a large, though sometimes has to go up to an XL because he has broad shoulders and thick biceps.  I ordered him a large and he said he likes how they fit, but they seemed almost too tight in the back of the neck and on his lats.  The shirt hit above his lats if that makes sense.  The fit was perfect around his chest and stomach area/waist.  The shirt hit right below his waist.  If I order these again in a different color I will try the XL to see if he likes the fit a little better on his neck and lats.  I think the XL may be too loose and baggy in other areas though. They seem to be decent quality for the price.  The fabric is thin and breathable for working out in."
655,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Overall, a new favorite. My husband loves it. Not too bulky, good for layering. Neck hole was a little tighter than expected but, still comfortable. We will be ordering more, and he appreciates the variety of colors!"
656,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Very cute dress! Bought this dress for my 6yr old granddaughter and it fits her perfectly! The length is perfect, it is not sheer at all and it's incredibly soft!"
657,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars I love these tops
658,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love these! Comfy and stylish Love these! Ordered them in two colors!
659,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Great hoodie This hoodie fits in all the right places, it feels good and looks good!"
660,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Best tank top ever Love these
661,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Dress basic and comfortable My daughter turned 7 and I bought 10 years old, because she is toler for her age."
662,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,It is good! I enjoyed the product. I think I need medium but it preference
663,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"with good long sleeves (I always have that problem of the ... I bought two of these hoodies, one a size larger than the other. Both are very warm, with good long sleeves (I always have that problem of the sleeves being two or three inches too short, because I'm tall for a girl.) I am a female, so I was expecting it to be a bit tight in the chest area, if anywhere, but was pleased to see that it wasn't. The one I got in the larger size it quite a bit too large, but that's more my fault than the product's. The smaller size fits perfectly, with a bit a wiggle room, and they both arrived within a week of ordering. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase, and would buy again."
664,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"the size small fit fine. If you want them to be more compression ... I weigh 120lbs, 32DD bra;  the size small fit fine. If you want them to be more compression type I'd suggest sizing down. Good quality, breathable."
665,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great! Beautiful color and sized as expected.
666,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Hoodie Product Review Good fit and comfort will recommend this product
667,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"PERFECT HOT SALMON PINK! It runs a bit smaller than some hoodies that are labeled Large, but I’m fine with that as I’m losing weight currently anyway. Just maybe something to keep in mind for those that aren’t. It could also just be my body type.<br /><br />ANYWAYS, as you can see the color of this hoodie is beyond brilliantly STUNNING. Definitely not the orangey color portrayed in the sellers photo. Hot salmon pink is one of my all time favorite colors and I feel like it’s hard to find in clothing items so I’m stoked I came across this! It’s typical hoodie material, so very comfy. I’ll update how the color is affected after washing."
668,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell hoodie..always great Very worth the money but runs a little<br />large..hoping it shrinks a tad..if you layer which I do then it becomes a perfect fit.
669,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Neleus Y tank top I don’t have anything bad to say about these Y back tanks other than they seem to be great. I’m 5’7 and about 150 ish pounds . The size chart was helpful . My chest is 38 inches so I went with the small instead if the medium .
670,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Tight fitting I love how tight fitting it is!
671,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Best Quality Hoodie for the price I love these Russell Athletic hoodies since they’re great quality for the price. I am 6’0 tall and 200 lbs and a 2XL fit perfect. Pilling accumulates somewhat faster than I expected but it is not a huge deal. I will definitely be buying more of these.
672,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great hoodie. True to size and very soft.
673,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great buy Ordering all the colors!!!
674,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Buy it! It's so worth it! I love this sweatshirt!

679,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Surprisingly nice I bought these for my wife after she saw someone wearing them and asked wear she got them. She liked them so much, I just ordered her two pair for her birthday. A lot of colors and styles available."
680,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice support I like them very much
681,4,B0928FSGGD,1,8/10 I really enjoy these shirts! I’m 5’7 and 145lbs and order a small because I like a form fitting feel. My only complaint is the logo on the shirt I wish it was either smaller or no logo at all. But still worth it!
682,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good buy Just right for late fall mornings and great as a first layer in the winter.  He really likes this hoodie for work.
683,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice Delivered
684,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Well made!! Fit well. Very well made.
685,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Super soft & comfy Wife and daughter both love these!! They are super soft and comfy. Would buy again and have bought 2 more pair in different colors
686,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Stretchy material base layer.  Good. Pretty much fits to size. Like the product.
687,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Love it will be ordering more in the future!
688,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Buying more! I bought a large, and am 5'3&#34;, 130 lbs. I purposely bought this big to then tie it in front to add some texture. It is a great quality and the color is beautiful. I will be buying in more colors! This is one of the greatest tank tops for leisure or working out!"
689,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great quality Great base layer for winter sports or stand alone layer for indoor workouts.
690,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Sweatpants US They fit small , wish they were a little stechy-er, I’m 5’8 I weigh 232lbs I  always buy XL but this time I guess I needed an 2X"
691,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,When drying make sure there is no Velcro! I love how it snugs around my chest but not in a tight way if that makes sense? Long story short I love then
692,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,They make your booty look incredible!! Great purchase! These leggings are AMAZING! I am going to buy 2 more as we speak. I highly recommend!! Completely squat proof and so soft.
693,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,i like this sweatshirt i like the look and fit
694,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,good Great fit. If you pull them above the waist you might get a line down there
695,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice set Arrived on time.  Youth loves them.
696,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"but after trying one on it was perfect for my 40DD chest Have not worn them to Yoga yet, but after trying one on it was perfect for my 40DD chest.  I think I am going to love these!"
697,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"never want another brand again!! i love these leggings! i'm 5'3"" and 120 and the XS fits incredibly. i'll see how they hold up once they've been washed and hung to dry, but i'm so excited to wear these to the gym!! they feel soft, light, and breathable"
698,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Ordered 2 more I am 5’4”, 155 lbs, 36DD. Medium fits great as a fitted body hugging fit but not too tight. If a loser fit is preferred then large would be a good fit. I ordered 2 more!"
699,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Decent and cheap I'm not a fan of the material, it's a lot like a high school football jersey. The cut is nice and allows my body to breath and that's the real plus here. I'm 5'10"" and about 210 with a bit of a beer belly (working on it lol) and a large will fit perfect once I loose a couple more pounds, but again the material is not ""light"" or stretchy but not horrible either. I might buy more in a few weeks bc of the cut."
700,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars The color is lighter than I expected.
701,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Love it! I am obsessed with workout clothes and I love this top. I ordered army green and color is fantastic. Cute style. For reference I am 5'4, 140lbs, athletic build, size 2-4 and a small fit perfectly. I just ordered 2 more colors :)"

704,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"So cute! I love these! Admittedly I haven’t worn them a lot yet, so I’m not sure how durable they are yet. They’re so flattering!"
705,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Love it. Perfect one for workout. Not too naked and not too fully. Just perfect to see ur muscle working while training.
706,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great
707,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love this dress! I love this dress! Love the pockets, perfect length and loose fit! I put a belt on it to dress it up. Wish it came in more prints, other than polka dot!"

711,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great quality Ordered a small for my 12 yo he is 5”5 and 120 not to baggy but airy
712,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Super comfortable I ordered 2xl and have a 46"" chest and it fit really loose around the waist which I wanted that's why I went up a size. Shirts are very comfortable"
713,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good Not best quality, but good for the money"
714,5,B0928FSGGD,1,I love these! I have 9 of these! I wear them to work and I work out in them. Fits perfect! Keeps you warm too! I’m 5’8 - 155#. One of my best Amazon purchases!  True to size. I bought Medium.
715,4,B097RFTKJP,1,"Dress fit Would have prefer a snap in the back not a tie in the side. I didnt realize it had a tie until I received it. It was somewhat hidden in the picture but, overall, I like the dress."
716,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Five Stars really good im 5'8 and I have 150 pound medium side is good for me
717,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great fit! Great fit! I'm 6.1 268 pounds and the U.S. 2X fits nicely.
718,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Boyfriend LOVES This My boyfriend had a Nike hoodie that shrunk every time we washed it and dried it.  We had to air dry it which was way too much trouble.  I studied all the hoodies and gave this as a gift.  He totally loves it,  keeps showing me how warm it is and how well made it is.  I finally got a winner by reading reviews!  It's warm, thick and made well.  True to size.  He wears an XL and it was perfect.  The Nike ran small."
719,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Nice fit.
720,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Sudadera Si buena , comoda...es igual.como.se ve en la.foto"
721,5,B09M6X79V9,1,I love this product I totally love my tops they worked out just great for me
722,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Sizing I ordered a medium in this.. and it's just a tad bigger .. but, then again, the small probably would be too small. It seems to me that sizing has changed over the years to become a bit larger."
723,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Good fit and warm.
724,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Super soft Super soft
725,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Get these!! These are amazing!! I get compliments every time i wear them! Cant wait to get another pair!
726,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,LilBetter Polka Dot Maxi Dress This is one of my Summer favorites . This dress is super comfy and looks really cute. The material is soft and it's very well made.At the time of purchase they didn't have my size in another color. But I will be keeping an eye out for other styles and colors. LilBetter is a Good Quality brand . It's hard for me to find Maxi dresses that fit and aren't too long because of my height. But This dress was Perfect all the way around ! The price is awesome and shipping fast. Thanks for making my purchase easy . I highly recommend this seller you won't be disappointed.
727,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,BUY THEM! I can't say how great this product is. I suffer from gynocomastia and it sure helps and makes me feel better.
728,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfy! These are extra comfy, flattering and wick away moisture.  I use them as an extra layer in cool weather, as a tank top for exercise or to lounge in.  Multiple uses!  Afordable and good quality."
729,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great shirt A little small but it fit well. It does not rub around the arms. Good price for the product. Would buy again.
730,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Draws eyes to the chest I’m at a 38DD and I was hoping to wear this dress to work with leggings, but it’s just too busty for me to feel comfortable.<br />It has a pleasing swing,beautiful color and it’s good for hiding belly pooch. I would keep it if I had a smaller chest."
731,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great buy Greatest quality and materials looks expensive. Perfect for outings. Very comfortable to wear and doesn’t fed away color after washing. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for something that is outstanding for any occasion.
732,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"It hides all my fat! I like how it hides my blubber. Bitches be thinkin’ I ain’t fat, but I really be."
733,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars colors are great and they fit very well.
734,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Love these joggers! These are so comfy I never want to change. If you're tall definitely size up for leg length but I'm a standard US small and these fit great, slightly high on the ankle but nothing I'm worried about. I ordered the teal because I've been looking for pants this color for three years and it's absolutely GORGEOUS! the color is exactly as pictured. The texture is slightly odd (comfy and stretchy) but does have a slightly plastic feel to them just in case that matters to anyone. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about it because tactile stuff can bother me but after doing a morning stretch in these babies I'm obsessed."
735,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Nice and roomy I didn't want a sweatshirt that was too tight.  I liked how this one fit.  Plenty of room but not too sloppy.
736,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Perfect AMAZING. I'm usually a size 6 or Medium and ~145 lbs, and these fit perfectly on me. Great for working out. My legs are on the slightly shorter side, and these hit my ankle perfectly; I'd assume if you are super tall, that these might go above your ankle. Honestly like these as much as Lululemon and way more than Alo."
737,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Perfection! Very nice, fit like a glove!"
738,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Don't hesitate worth the money These tank tops are great.
739,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,One of my favorite pairs of pants! These pants are so comfy and fit is nice. I will be purchasing more for sure.
740,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Super cute runs HUGE Overall love this dress it just runs very large
741,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Excellent Excellent
742,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Ice Cream Dress My daughter found this dress on a YouTube video and ask for it. She absolutely loves it! It’s her favorite dress!
743,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Versatile Dress was super comfortable and looks very nice. Can dress up or casual in it. Easy to travel with as well!
744,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Super comfy and flattering I love these, they are soft and stretchy.  I do not work out with them, but I think that would be five.  I had to size up to a medium, I am usually a small but didn’t like how it bunched a little in the pelvic area.  I bought one of the camo patterns and will be purchasing another pair, probably few charcoal Gray."
745,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Awesome pants! Great fit great material great Qaulity!
746,4,B076QD9NP1,1,"also flows beautifully!! Bought for daughters elementary graduation. Fabric is very soft and breathable,also flows beautifully!!!"
747,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,The hoodie is well-made. This is a gift for someone who works outdoors a lot.  The hoodie was a request.
748,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Buy them! These are literally the most comfortable pair of athletic pants I've ever put on!  I bought 4 pair because they are so comfortable!
749,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Fits like a glove. Loved it. No dislike, also bought for my man's Father's Day."
750,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect for summer... and not-so shaven legs! Very cute but I didn't know there was a seam right down the middle in front of the dress. The bust area needs darts because it puckers but maybe I bought a size too large. It's my go-to lazy day dress!
751,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Four Stars I normally wear L, I read all of the comments and ordered XL, next time I will order XXL."
752,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"For the price, this is a steal. Very nice but not very countouring."
753,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Awesome Great material, and fit. Loved that it arrived in time. Would definitely recommend it."
754,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,It works For the most part I like this shirt. It fit as expected and is great to stay cool while working out.  The only thing I have against it is that the neck feels small and tight.  It's not on my neck at all but it does feel constricting.  I'll probably cut it to make it work better for me.
755,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Warmest and best fitting sweatshirt ever My boyfriend has always bought these sweatshirts for work and casual wear in the colder months and won’t buy any other. The fit is perfect. Not too big and not too small. He even wears shirts under so because he doesn’t wear coats. He gave me one because I am ALWAYS cold and wear 3 layers and it is amazing. It is the warmest sweatshirt I have ever worn. Needless to say, he lost one of his."
756,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good value for money Good value for money -- quality fabric, durable and fits like expected."
757,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars As expected
758,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great value Really like them great value.
759,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Love it I love
760,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great Like it very much, lightweight and nice."
761,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Best of all no wrinkles This dress was so cute. My daughter wore it to a beach wedding. Best of all no wrinkles!
762,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great product Great quality and the fix is perfect!
763,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"The sizes we ordered 2 in large, and they were not the same size. one had a ""L"" lable but the size was small (too small for my size). This is a problem of quality control"
764,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Stylish. Unbelievable price. Beautiful color (blue and red) I bought something like this from Cabela's for $40 in 2011 and it's still my favorite. The design of this item is very smart: long sleeves for sun protection, snug fit to flatter your figure. Right thickness that can be worn underneath or by itself. Most tops on the market today are big and shapeless and require tailoring (e.g, adding darts and taking in the sides) to look nice. So this item is God sent. I intend to wear it for walking in my neighborhood. However, I don't know if it will be too hot since the temp will be above 80 in the next five months, and my neighborhood is very hilly. It should be good for summer hikes in the Rockies as the temperature will be cooler (every 1000 ft up is 3.6 degrees' drop).<br /><br />I am 5', 120 lb, bust 36B. I usually wear S or PS. However, due to the measurement chart, I ordered M. But it was a bit too loose. I tried size S. It's a tiny bit tight on the bust, but it fits me perfectly everywhere else. So you may or may not have to size up.<br /><br />I would like to have more choices of colors. I like dark colors, e.g., red, blue and black. But the best I can get is 2 dark colors and one light (white or pale green). I don't see how the light color can work as when it's wet with sweat people can see through it. So basically I buy 3 and give away 1 to Salvation Army. That raises the price by 50%."
765,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Fit as expected very comfy Fit as expected, very comfy!"
766,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Love these! Will  be ordering more!
767,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great sweatshirt. Holds up well and doesn’t ride up on your back.
768,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great fit not hot Love these great fit and don't make me hot
769,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Amazing These are my new favorite. Ordering another pair.
770,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Wonderful White 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
771,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Gets compliments every time he wears these My husband gets complimented every time he wears these. He is long waisted so I thought they looked like they would be too short but they are perfect. Will probably order again.
772,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Just what I needed! The black tank top ripped under the arm as soon as I tried to get it off. The others fit and stretch just fine.
773,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Good quality material and is very flattering Very nice material flatters the body and is easy
774,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great workout shirt Light weight durable. Also makes you look and feel like a body builder
775,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love these joggers so comfortable Good quality and great price
776,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars very happy with these, nice quality"
777,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Me gusto Me encanto el material y está como esperaba
778,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,It’s not see trough I love it Awesome
779,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars XL was huge. I wear XL shirts and should've ordered a Large hoodie.
780,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Feels great with enough support & be comfortable. I wear them all day instead of a bra.
781,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Four Stars Snug but worked well in cold weather for me when I was coaching softball.
782,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Fantastic running shirts! These are fantastic and great bargain for the money! I was a little uncertain as to what size to buy, I usually wear xs/s and my chest measurement is 32 (which is included in both the small & medium). I went with the medium, and they fit very comfortably! I'm really happy with these!"
783,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Tall girls these are for you! I want to preface this by saying im 6'1 and it's hard finding leggings that fit both my legs and torso. They come to just above my ankle but can easily be pulled down for more length. I'm about 155 lbs and got a size medium. They're very high rise which is nice because it sucks you in and you know they won't fall down when you're working out. also, there is a seam that runs down the butt line but it doesn't look weird like some other comments said. one way to fix this if you don't like it as much is to pull from the sides of the leggings in towards your booty crack (yes I know sounds weird but trust me it will help define your butt and get rid of the mono-cheek). Ps, I totally forgot to do this before taking pics. As far as I can tell they passed the squat test too! I have yet to workout in them but will review after I do :) GET U A PAIR!"
784,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Thick fabric, I am 5'5 150lbs and went for the L, great fit!"
785,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Worth it!!! Still have it two years after purchase. No tears or fraying. This pullover has gotten me through a few tough winters!
786,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars ok
787,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Love!!!! A-freaking-mazing!!!! Gymshark....move over!! Great fit, supper breathebale, soft, true to size! Love love love!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
788,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Go down a size run big! Very stretchy I'm 245 pounds, I ordered a large but because they a very stretchy. It's to lose to hold my chest up. I could have went down to a small and got tighter fit!"
789,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Good buy! For the price what’s not to LOVE! I will buy a size smaller just because I like it to be a little tighter under my shirts. Comfortable material so far.
790,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Super comfy fits perfect :333
791,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Nice Nice
792,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very pleased Good fit and very comfortable. Good value

795,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great fit So soft and flattering
796,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars I bought this for my son and he likes it and its decent quality.
797,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect weight for spring and fall. Very nice sweatshirt. Good weight fits not too big not too small.
798,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Five Stars This dress is great! Love the material, very versatile"
799,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great product Perfect. You will love it!!
800,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Not a bad buy I like them<br />A lot actually<br />I wish they had<br />Black, navy blue and green.<br />But I guess that’s how they get you to buy another set of 3 shirts. Lol"
801,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great These are amazing! Super soft and comfy!
802,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,perfect fit Exactly what i was looking for. Size was was perfect.
803,5,B09M6X79V9,1,size is ture to size love it
804,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars deal
805,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great quality Great for great look. I like the material it was made out of. Definitely buying again.
806,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Re-ordered the day they arrived! These hoodies are great! You always have to be careful buying clothes on amazon I’ve ordered shirts that were supposed to be large that wouldn’t fit a toddler.  But these hoodies fit perfectly, the material is high quality, and they look good! The swoop at the bottom is very stylish.  I was so impressed I ordered another set of 3 the day they arrived."
807,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Very high quality
808,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Looks and feels good for the money Everyone was saying the sizes were too small so I ordered a size bigger than I otherwise would’ve and it was too big. I then ordered my size and it fit fine. I like them.
809,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"I really like these leggings They were a little bit itchy at the lower knees and down, but I am VERY picky. The fit was great. I am 5'3 122 pounds and I ordered a small. The fit was perfect. The ankle-length was great and it is a very high rise *above belly button, but I love leggings like that. It does not really hide fat in the stomach or hips."
810,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Everyone should have a go-to hoodie in their repertoire. My last doppelganger of this hoodie lasted me 3 years and I wore it whenever the weather deemed fit. Finally faded, shrunk and with a ripped pocket, my cheap behind decided to grab a new one. Glad I did. This thing is to me what a comfy set of PJs might be to someone else. With summer approaching I'll have to hang it up and show off my fat belly but I look forward to our many days together when fall arrives again. Def worth the price and fits a bit baggy at first but after a few washes(and dries, which I'm avoiding at all costs cos I love it a little loose on me) it should fit a tad snugger on you."
811,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Nice product Fits nice and is really sweat resistant!
812,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Very comfortable These pants are SO comfortable and breathable. Working out in them isn’t an issue either- they are squat proof!
813,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Perfect dress.  My granddaughter puts it on every chance she gets. I bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves this dress.
814,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable sweatshirt. I love Russell Athletic sweatshirts because they are soft and comfortable. I bought my sweatshirt in the middle of a weight loss regiment. It fits a little more loose than I like it but nice just the same.
815,4,B009R09Z8W,1,True to size Fits great
816,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice shirts. I like the shirts but not the kind of material i thought they were.
817,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Runs small Only complaint I have is they run a little small.
818,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love this dress This is my third one! super comfy and you can always add a loose belt at the hip, if you want it to be a bit more fitted."
819,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Five Stars So comfortable! I love this tank!
820,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Compression tank does what it promises As a compression tank, this works perfectly.  I'm 5'11"" and 240lbs and fat but losing weight.  Bought these to go under some of my new clothes.  That was definitely the right fit for a compression tank top, not for a casual undershirt.  Seems to wick the sweat nicely."
821,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars Kinda small but okay
822,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Worked perfect. Bought it bigger so I could layer clothes ... Bought for hunting season. Light weight, but still warm. Worked perfect. Bought it bigger so I could layer clothes under."
823,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Beautiful I saw this near identical dress at very high end store made by designer for 15 times more! I washed dress on gentle because I ordered 2 sizes up. This dress is predominantly RAYON which shrinks. So, cold water and hang dry each wash. Use gentle cycle. Love this dress!"
824,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Sturdy Great product and the price? Forget about it! Lol. Seriously though these are great for under your dri fit material
825,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,love these! Incredible quality
826,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Gaping arm holes I bought a three pack and two out of three of them fit fine. The third one had gaping arm holes!  I wish I could just exchange that one instead of the whole package.<br /><br />UPDATE: got a replscement, worked up a sweat hiking in the Rockies - fabric is not moisture wicking!"
827,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Love Love this!
828,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Best leggins ever! The best legginssss!😻😻❤️❤️  135lb 40 hips... small! ✅
829,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good Sweatshirt 10/10
830,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Worth the money These are so worth the money spent! They are stretchy and very comfortable! I love the pockets and how thick they are! I bought them in two different colors and I will be buying more!
831,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Super cute Great for the 4rh
832,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Good It was very comfortable
833,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Room to grow It was a little bit big in the chest for my daughter but she loves it anyways and will have room to grow!
834,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Love it, cute pattern Love it, cute pattern.  Quality is what I expected. Fits as sized. My daughter loved it for her birthday party.  My daughter wears a size 6x-7 in girls, I ordered a 10 and it was big on her."
835,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Runs large My husband uses these shirts for the gym
836,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars GREAT SHIRT
837,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Worth buying My favorite  hoodie, needs a deeper pouch"
838,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars came fast and good quality
839,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars Super cute!
840,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Nice Nice, cool shirt for hot summer days! Fit perfect and just ordered 3 more."
841,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Last forever I have worn Russell Athletic sweat pants and sweat shirts for many many years. They wear like iron. They hold their color and shape. They are well sewn so I never have any mending to do on them. Buy with confidence.
842,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Comfortable Sweatpants I am very pleased with this purchase. The sweatpants are made very well and were a good deal for the price I paid. I'd say they fit true to size. I ordered my regular size which is a medium and they are comfortable, the waistband string makes it easy to adjust if you want them a bit tighter or looser giving a perfect fit. I am about 5'10"" and I am always worried about pants being long enough, but the length is perfect, not too long but definitely long enough and the leg width is comfortably roomy without being too baggy.<br />I think a size small could have also fit me if I wanted a snugger fit in the legs."
843,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Five Stars The material is light, breathable, and has some give, which is what I was looking for."
844,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"It’s comfortable, keeps me warm, and it’s my favorite color: Orange It’s comfortable, keeps me warm, and it’s my favorite color: Orange<br />I use it mainly for riding my bicycle."
845,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great buy! Love these! They wash well and do not lose their shape or color.
846,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect! I loved these tops!!! Fit perfect. Great for working out.
847,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Comfortable and flattering Great shirts that I've been able to wear for winter tennis to keep me warm. Not too thick, great for layering under jackets."
848,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great product, runs small I'd give them a higher rating but the sizing runs a bit small. Wicks away moisture."
849,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Sleeves are short The sleeves are really short but the rest of it fits well and is a good material
850,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Flattering cut Very soft and nice flattering cut.
851,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great hoofie
852,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great material This hoodie was perfect fit great material my husband loves it.

856,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"warm and the best sweatshirt around Soft, warm and the best sweatshirt around."
857,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Best Tank Top Perfect! Just buy it.
858,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,I do reccomend Run pretty small but they're great quality and the customer service is exceptional.
859,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Ok fit Sleeves are a little wide for my liking but overall fits well
860,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Quality breathable workout gear that fits perfectly Quality breathable workout gear that fits perfectly (medium for 160lb, 5’9”)."
861,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great prices and fit Great quality, great price and looks and feels just like the over priced name brand"
862,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"A nice liner - or exercise wear. I ordered these to use under shirts, so the overshirt would not need to be buttoned up. I use them to keep shirts hanging smoothly instead of getting caught up on my body, for the summer. And they are great liners for warmth and comfort of fit when wearing heavier, colder weather clothing."
863,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Comfortable
864,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice Comfy Work out shirts I should have got a size smaller. But I did like the shirts and the quality over all.
865,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Larger chested ladies...need to wear bra underneath. Nice top, but big. I'm 32DD and thinner build. I ordered XS and it fits just right. Definately need to wear sports bra underneath bc no support. Material thinner than my other workout tops. I gave 4 stars bc these will not make it to the gym for me, which is why I placed the order. Instead are perfect to wear with shorts on hot day."
866,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,The positive reviews are no exaggeration! I plan to wear these shirts to workout in as well as layering in cold weather. I was nervous about the fit but the majority of reviews noted to size up and I was not disappointed. I am 5’6” 210lbs and purchased an XXL. The quality of the material is more than what I expected. Very pleased with this purchase!
867,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Soft and Cozy Love these hoodies! I have several different colors. They are so soft on the inside and not too heavy or too light... just right!
868,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Baggy in the sleeves 5’8” 180. I usually wear large sweatshirts.  This one fits wel in the chest but the sleeves are very baggy I prefer something a little more fitting when I go out.  However it would make a great lounger with this fit.
869,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,6’2” 220 perfect fit. I’m 6ft 2 inches tall and weigh 220lbs. These tanks fit perfectly.

885,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Good fit Fits well. Not for those who want a modest fit. Wish the matching too had fit me. Would have made for a cute outfit.

895,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Love! I love these!! I have to order some more!
896,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Exactly what I wanted Love the sweatshirts
897,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Soft and comfortable Perfect fit
898,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice moisture wicking material Nice material good quality but clingy like workout tank tops bought xlg to hopefully be loose fit but not so
899,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"These tanks are great quality material These tanks are great quality material! They are stylish, thin lightweight material and wear beautifully. We decided to purchase more after receiving because they are such good quality for the cost."
900,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,so cute! it seemed to fit a little small but i absolutely love it. it is so comfortable and so cute. i want more colors now.
901,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Material on the lighter side, but very comfortable. Material on the lighter side, but very comfortable."
902,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great lounge, athletic or yoga pants Awesome pants, good quality material, breathable, suitable for all year wear.<br />I wore them in a very cold, windy environment and was feeling great, warm but not hot, very comfortable.<br />Material is off medium thickness, not see through or clingy, doesn’t accentuate any skin flows, stretchy, feels pleasant against bare skin.<br />Great design-definitely not leggings style more like yoga or lounge pants, slightly baggy through the thighs and thinning out down the ankle with a cuff at the bottom.<br />Looks exactly as presented in pictures posted in this listing even the color was captured better by their photographers than by my phone’s camera.<br />In regards to the fit-for some reason Amazon recommended me to get XL, but its 12/14 and my regular size is 8-10 so I choose to go with Large and it fits me perfectly.<br />Waist has a wide stretchy band than can be easily adjusted according to your personal preference whether you like it high waisted or wear a bit lower.<br />Length is perfect for me as well-not too short or to long, just right and I’m an average height woman-5’5/5’6.<br />All in all like these pants, would probably get another pair in different pattern and recommend it to anyone looking for casual, comfortable pair of leisure wear 👍🏻"
903,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,It’s thin material. But looks very nice on. It was a bit lighter material then I expected. I can ware a long sleeve shirt under it  comfortably. So I decided to keep it. It will be nice in the spring and into the summer for a lighter cover up in the warmer temperatures.
904,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Size as expected. Good fit. Good price.
905,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great fit Good fit not too tight
906,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Five Stars BEAUTIFUL... Fits great! Ordered an 8-9 for my 9 year old almost 10 she is tall and skinny!
907,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Just what I expected So far I like the fleece crew, but haven't had it long enough to see how its washes and stains, I seems to have trouble with white fleece staining easily so am waiting to see"
908,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"SQUAT PROOF I would put 5 stars but there are some discrepancies between the material for each color. The black is AMAZING. Thick fabric, fits as expected, just great overall. I then purchased the grey... much thinner & stretchier fabric (still squat proof), & run a little bit bigger than the black. THEN I ordered the light blue ombré... different fabric than the others I ordered, even bigger than the grey pair, & the fabric was thinner than the black pair but similar to grey (still squat proof).<br />I love these tights, esp bc I reverted to them for a cheaper option after having 3 pairs of gym shark tights.<br />Don’t let this review stop you from ordering, they’re great for the price & quick shipping BUT just be mindful to not expect perfection when you get them. Unless you order the black :) also I ordered a M in all - returning the ombré for a small to see if that works better. I’m 140lb, 5’8 & wear a medium from gym shark & typically a size 6 in jeans. Hope this helps!"
909,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Feels Nice Fit Great
910,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,great hoodie. Person I bought it for really likes it.  great hoodie.
911,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Saving me $$$ on heating oil This is a very heavy weight warm sweatshirt! I've had it for a year now and it has held up great! I hang it to dry... I ordered it huge and it has stayed huge and wonderful. It's my inside the house where I keep the thermostat at 65' survival garment. I can pull the sleeves down over my hands - at the same time the cuffs have enough elastic to stay in place if I push the sleeves up.
912,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Comfortable Comfortable and not itchy.
913,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,I would buy this outfit again. I like to fit of this outfit the colors were pretty and it was a loose fit so I was very comfortable.

931,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Nice. As expected.
932,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect gift for Dad I bought this for my dad because his previous one that he was overly attached to was to beat up. It is actually a very very deep blue it’s almost black. So I would not say that this is particularly a navy blue it’s more of a blue black. But the fit is great and every time I visit my parents my father is wearing this lol
933,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfect Size, Exactly as described Great shirts that were true to my size. I went with what i normally get and it worked out fine. The shirts are breathable mesh and feel great- Will def buy another pack!"

946,5,B009R09Z8W,1,awesome hoodie! Fits just as expected. Feels nice and warm and the colors are bright and vibrant.
947,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I love this dress I love this dress! I Came back for the red one after buying the navy.<br />I'm 5' 8&#34; and t is long enough on me.. the front kind of dips up, but i actually am wearing it backwards. I like it best that way..<br />I think it's meant for someone a little less buxom (36DD here)..but if i turn it around it totally takes the weird pucker away from under my arms. I would recommend for the price. Fabric is thick and not at all cheap looking to me."
948,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice sweatshirt good price It is a loose but comfortable fit.  Perfect for casual wear, which is exactly what my husband wanted.  Good value too."
949,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfy The fit is perfect and they are very comfortable
950,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Warm Good product
951,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"we always like this brand Russell Athletics is a go to brand for us.  This was rather more lightweight and not as heavily cotton as some previously preferred purchases of a style they no longer make, but the fit is right, comfy and consistent.  I do wish that RA would still offer the higher, heavier cotton content, with side pockets rather than pouch that they currently offer exclusively...but RA is still more comfortable and consistent than any of the options we tried.  Returned other brands and styles.  Kept this one."
952,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great Fit I love these! Lightweight material and the fit is great.
953,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Best Hoodie Ever True to size, comfortable, warm and soft, best hoodie ever!"

955,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"The bottom rolls up I am using them for lymphedema due to mastectomy surgery , they are wonderful they woke my nerves up around my left shoulder blade and I can move my arm now .  What I dislike is the roll up the bottom of them ."
956,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,great product this product fits as expected and is comfortable to wear in the gym. love it and will be ordering more
957,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Sweatshirt! SUPER comfy and worked perfectly for the 5k I purchased it for.  It's now one of my go-to sweatshirts to wear.
958,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Worth the money Great sweatshirt, I would buy again"
959,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Liked it. Nice shirt. Fit nice.
960,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect summer dress I am so happy with this flowing flirty dress.  I purchased a large.  I’m 5’2” and 165 pounds.  It fits me<br />Perfect!  Comes right to the back of my ankle and the front is slightly higher.  Very easy to walk in and right out of the bag no hemming needed.  I probably won’t put it in the dryer so it doesn’t shrink.  The pockets are great. Hidden and don’t add weight to the dress.  Perfect summer dress
961,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Perfect I'm 61 with a 39"" waist with a large chest..I cannot find a tanktop that fits me anywhere  until now! Definitely  a Good fit for guys over 225lbs. U won't be disappointed"
962,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"value for the $$$$ comfortable, light weight. Perfect for workout or everyday wear. Great value for the money."
963,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great dress for the $$$ Really like it! Very comfy and love the side pockets bc I can put my keys and nick nacks while walking.
964,5,B09M6X79V9,1,The name concerned me but I Love them. I love the fit. They are a perfect first layer for New England weather. They are long enough to stay tucked in. Smooth enough to slip under anything. They hold up to many washings . The colors are bold. the material feels nice on. I am very sensitive most man made materials make me sweat these did not . I highly recommend them.
965,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Nice fit These leggings fit nice and are true to size.  Very comfortable and sweat wicking.
966,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Four Stars nice patterns of the jacket kind of snug on the arms.
967,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,So soft and comfy It is so pretty and comfy and has really soft material.
968,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Nice fit and material
969,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Perfect fit! I have tried on a hundred pairs of yoga pants and I NEVER find any that fit right. These are perfect AND no camel toe!!
970,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Slim look Great for fit<br />Love the way I look in my clothes
971,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Very Stylish Loved this product. Fits well and very fashionable and comfortable. Wore it to work and to relax around. Missing a star because I'm holding out to see how it will wash up.
972,5,B0928FSGGD,1,True fit Very soft close body fit.I wear Most DOg in tops but had to order size 2X.
973,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Highly recommended. Love these shirts. Comfortable light weight design. Perfect for runners. Highly recommended.
974,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect overall Perfect overall
975,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"forget nike and champion I been wearing navy blue full zip front hooded sweatshirts on the job for 40 years. champion, nike, off brands, and russell is my favorite. soft warm fabric, generous fit, durable, colorfast. my only beef is that the zipper gives out before the rest of the sweatshirt. they've used metal, ykk delrin, plastic coil and they all fail while the sweatshirt is still in good condition. no problem, I get another one for dress and use the old one to shovel snow! a little hard to find on the stores so I was very pleased to find these on amazon, and in 3x! I like them with a little room to layer and to just slouch. it's a very spacious 3x."
976,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,As advertised. Exactly what I expected. Fits great
977,4,B09M6X79V9,1,X-Lg fit is comparable to Lg. I wanted these for the gym. The fit is too tight so I'm giving them away. Don't order if you want/need an X-Lg.
978,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Worth every Penney Husband lives it. Can't beat Russell brand.
979,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Love Love this dress, would recommend."
980,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,They are perfect!!! Loved my shirts!!! Perfect fit
981,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Quality Great item! I don’t own expensive items to compare them to but these have held up surprising well to washes and wear. As a stay at home parent with 4 kids they have proven very durable too! I bought a few more and sent them to people as gifts too!
982,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Nice tanks Nice tanks
983,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Happy I bought these I love these pants. They are very comfortable and I find myself wearing them all the time.
984,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great basic sweat shirt My Russell sweat shirt fits great.  Washes up great and  plenty roomy. Lots of great colors.
985,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Pretty This dress fits perfect. Makes me look like I have an hourglass figure. I’m tall and have no hips. Very flattering. But can tell it’s cheap up close
986,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Yes please! These are legit. Love the length as I’m a bit larger on the belly area. They definitely make me feel comfortable with working out. I also love the freedom they give me in terms of movement. I don’t feel constricted in the least.
987,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Mine Was exactly what I wanted
988,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars She likes it
989,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great tanks If you have a little extra around the waist you may want to size up so they don’t rise up on you at the waist. Other than that, these are great tops!"
990,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Big +A Awesome
991,5,B0928FSGGD,1,I don't wear these as work out shirts -- I wear these under sweaters in the winter at work and they're very comfortable. I'm not sure how they would hold up with a work out but so far they're one of my favorite basic clothing items.
992,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,thankS I LOVE THIS HOODIE AND AM SURE IT WILL LAST ME A LONG TIME BECAUSE THE WELL DONE MATERIAL THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME FROM WINTER ;)
993,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good quality!!! Fits perfectly! Quality product!
994,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"GOOD WEIGHT, WIDE SLEEVES Glad I read the reviews. It runs large in width so I ordered a large for a man who usually wears an X-large and it fits well. The sleeves are wide so it isn't a sleek look but he likes it. If you prefer a slimmer look this isn't your shirt. If you size down the body is fine but sleeves are still wider than some styles. It's comfortable and a nice weight. He prefers to wear these like a tee shirt in the winter without a shirt underneath and these are just right.. Am ordering more today. Only concern washed it for the second time today and no shrinkage but I think I saw a tiny bit of pilling when I took it out of the dryer today. Time will tell and if it's a big deal will repost."
995,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars Fit the way I was hoping for and shipped right away.soft and cozy
996,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Had for a YEAR and still look/feel Great! These are great for the price! They look and feel so similar to my gymshark pants. They are squat proof. I ordered a medium and at the time I weighed 139 lbs (about a year ago). I’m currently weighing 120 lbs and they are loose, but still fit! I love the color too. Just went on a hiking trip and wore these outdoors. They stood up to rock climbing as well!"
997,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Good value for a cute, summer casual dress. Good value for the price. It is exactly as it looks on my screen (nice, dark red with white polka-dots) but the seams ARE in the front, which accentuates the fact that the pattern doesn't quite match up. Meh, whatever.<br />Like the other (blue) dress I reviewed, I'd wear this at a beach resort / pool party / lunch on a patio sort of places, but not a dressy restaurant.<br />I'm 5'9 and 180lbs; usually wear sizes 12-14. This dress doesn't go to the floor - its exactly as the picture reflects - but I find it a little large in the chest area (I wear 38DD)."
998,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great Loved these so much have repurchased more!
999,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,See through Not the best material. Very see through.
1000,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Nice shirts I wear these often. I have a slim and very athletic build and they're comfortable to wear. The colors haven't faded in a couple of washings. I would say that I'm used to clothes not fitting very well, so if I were to nit-pick I'd say that they're too fat around the waist, but not by much."
1001,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,it is a perfect fit and the measurement was perfect It's soft and fit's great. It is perfect for a chilly day and to stay warm when the weather doesn't cooperate. I'll be buying a 2nd one soon
1002,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"pullover hoodie Absolutely love the color of this hoodie! First time I have every actually seen such a bright pink hoodie! Delivery was fast. The only issue I have is that after reading a few reviews I decided to go one size bigger than I would normally wear, and it would be great but the arms of the hoodie are humungous! Haven't washed it yet, hoping it will shrink just a little."
1003,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Love the product Perfect for a cookout
1004,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Yes, sports bra required! No, it's not a compression top. You should probably think of these as modest coverups for a sports bra. These are like very thin swimsuit tank tops. Slightly shiny, form fitting. They're not shapers. They are not the kind of compression top that helps muscle fatigue. They are compression-style. Sort of the same way a lot of &#34;sports&#34; bras are better described as &#34;sportY&#34;.<br /><br />If you normally need a sports bra for your sport, you'll still need it with this.  If people make unwelcome comments or facial expressions when you try to go braless in a tshirt, you'll still need one if you want to wear these out casually. (If you care, that is.)<br /><br />What they ARE good for: As a coverup over a sports bra under a martial arts uniform without adding too much heat. Dynamic stretching (so I assume they're fine for yoga?) Casual wear. Gardening. General cool summer comfort for those of us who can't get tank tops with built-in bras yet, even though it's 2017.<br /><br />I'm 36D and I can bend over in them without flashing anybody. They are resistant to riding up under pants/shorts but eventually with enough movement you'll have to pull them down again. The bottom hem stayed put longer than a regular ribbed tank; after 500 punches it wasn't at my belly button, yet, but it was aiming there. And I was cooler.<br /><br />If you want a form fitting top to stay put forever while doing bridges, or something, you should really get a leotard or unitard, though.<br /><br />I will be getting more. They work for what I want to use them for."
1005,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Let me clarify... These tank tops get all the stars!  They're cute with that subtle color along the top.  They are the perfect tanks to wear underneath your tops.  That being said, they are NOT compression tanks.  If you just need a fly tank that fits great and serves that tiny pop of color, this is perfect!"
1006,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Five stars! fits great, sleeves are great length (ordered 3XL) and the jacket is very warm but lightweight for a hooded sweatshirt."
1007,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good buy My son loved it.
1008,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Comfort and very pretty it is comfortable but the design fades so it's nice as a day dress.
1009,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits my husband great My husband bought these and he loves them. They are light wait and fit great. I have washed them several times and so far they still look great
1010,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,A Great Compression Shirt I liked the way the shirts felt.Thesleeves were  a little long.
1011,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,It arrived on time Fit me perfectly.
1012,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Great Casual Dress This dress is so comfortable and the fabric is so soft.  This is the perfect dress for casual wear to pair with boots (as shown in the picture).  Great buy for the price!
1013,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Awesome Love love this hoodie!!! Fits great right size great quality
1014,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great quality! Great quality! Fits great! I’m 5’7”/135 lbs female and a little baggy as I want.

1016,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute dress Super cute dress.  A tad tight in my chest (36ddd) but other than that exactly what I was expecting.
1017,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great shirt! Great design, great fit, like how these shirts look!"

1022,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Love these! Very comfortable, stylish, everyday pants. Can’t go wrong!!"
1023,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Good product, especially for the price. This is a light, nice fitting hoodie.  Excellent to “showcase your guns”…Hood is great to pull up when lying in the flat bench. Material is durable enough.  You can throw on a shirt under them, looks cool as well.  I get looks and compliments in this shirt, I have every color they make now.  For less than 10 bucks/ shirt, they’re a no brainer, seriously. I’ve been recommending them to friends and have gifted a few guys with these as well. Only advice, don’t by a size down, buy whatever size you’d normally wear in a comfortable hoodie.  I tried a size smaller than I usually wear (I wear XL, tried L) and it was too tight."
1024,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,happy with my purchase I’m 6’1 185<br />Medium fit wel.. happy with my purchase
1025,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Flattering compression Initially I didn’t even realize this was for working out. I just needed layers under my crop top sweaters. I’m glad I choose these. Very flattering.
1026,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Really nice workout tanks Good quality

1033,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Thick and warm Nice and thick and warm for working out outside when it's cold.  I use w no t-shirt underneath b/c I stay warmer that way when I sweat in the cold weather.  You can sweat in this hoodie and stay warm.  These hoodies do run big.  I am usually a 2XL on shirts, jackets, sweat shirts.  But I was swimming in the 2X.  Returned for XL and a bit snug but much better."

1037,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Flattering I bought this dress is a different color and loved it so much I bought a second one. The dress is flattering and cute. Like many other reviewers, I tied (a loose knot) in the strings and swung the knot around to the keyhole - which I wear in the back. I may even buy a 3rd dress since all the patterns are so lovely!"

1040,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"I am a 38C and needed the XL. Its a great fitting dress., but be careful with the top. It could be a bit snug depending on your chest size. It runs small in the chest. Other than that, love the fit, the pockets. Flows nice. Very comfy, nicely made for the cost."
1041,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars love these hoodies
1042,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Pullover hoody. This was purchased as a birthday gift for a relative.  He must like it very much because he wears it all the time.
1043,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Size down for compression Absolutely loving these tank tops so far. Only have had them for a couple weeks now, but they fit extremely snug and stay breathable. These are super helpful for weight loss leaving loose skin around your stomach. I ordered a size down, so I opted for a small, and I’m glad I did. Fits well underneath all my shirts. Adds a good extra layer for the colder weather too."
1044,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great hoodie Ordered this Hoodie for my daughter as a gift. The quality is good and she loves it.
1045,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfy Love these. So thick and comfy. My go to pants
1046,5,B09M6X79V9,1,fit I'm 5.3 125 lbs. the small fits perfect. The fabric is nice. I love them so much I bought 2 more packs.
1047,5,B076QD9NP1,1,So Cute! Super Cute! My daughter is super picky regarding material but she loved this! She said it’s super soft n comfy!
1048,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Boyfriend loved it Bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he wears it every day. He says it is super warm, comfortable, and durable. Would 100% recommend."
1049,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Good shirts, great price. No complaints, and the price was excellent."
1050,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love the no-seam in the waist I like this dress because it has no seam I the waist. I always end up looking pregnant with a waist seam so I liked this dress. I got a large which is what I normally wear.
1051,5,B09M6X79V9,1,I love these will buy again
1052,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,i am 6ft and 150lbs. it fit a tad ... i am 6ft and 150lbs. it fit a tad on the big size but i am a skinny chap. I'm sure one wash and it'll be what i wanted for sure.
1053,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Must have !!! I just love the fit and feel great in them. Thanks for making these, from neck shape to sleeve size, they’re incredible. I have now 6 of them n definitely will buy more when it’s time but they hold up so well"
1054,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Great product Looks great. Lightweight and holds up well with my workout
1055,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Soft, comfy, cute. Fits my tall frame and I'm pleased."
1056,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Great Twirl My granddaughter loves this dress. The kitties are a big wow, but the dress itself is a good design. Soft, semi fitted with a good twirl."
1057,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice sweatshirt I gave it a 4 because I got a 3x, and when washed it did shrink a little 2x would have been to small if it shrunk as well."
1058,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Nice Nice. Not to thin. Wore it when it was in the 30s out and kept me warm. It won’t stand up to wind though for sure
1059,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,amazon : do not ship to customer the product  in the ORIGINAL manufacturer PLASTIC BAG. it was rip'd great fit
1060,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Perfect fit.
1061,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Legit! I love these tanks for the gym. They are great quality, great fit. This is my second time ordering them :)"
1062,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,great quality nicest sweat shirt made out of nice material not cheap looking. Like it so much ordered another one .
1063,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"The fabric is cool, durable, good elasticity. Seamless shading contouring patterns. Soft comfortable material, easy to operate.  Absorb water well, use smaller size than usual but still comfortable without uncomfortable tight fitting."
1064,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Buy 1-2 sizes up These are cozy but I would have preferred them to be a bit looser. I am 5’3” and about 140 lbs. usually I wear a Medium but I bought a Large after reading reviews. So glad I did because these fit perfectly, but I actually wish they were a bit looser since I mainly bought these to throw on over my swim suit after my daughter’s swim lessons.  I should have ordered a XL."
1065,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"10/10 Excellent.  Comfortable and breathable.  Looks really good as well.  I'm 5'9, 170lbs, athletic, and small fits great.  Not slim fit which stinks if you're trying to bring out your best form, but 10/10 would buy again."
1066,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Best tank top The best tank top I have ever worn.
1067,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,great for cute dress; great for traveling
1068,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars These are great sweatshirts, they run a little large fitting  no big deal."
1069,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Workout/Vacation Tank Was looking for the perfect purple tank top for vacation to add a vinyl too!  These were great, and now I use it as a workout top!"
1070,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Great product for the price! My husband buys these expensive compress tanks that get ratted. For Christmas I decided to get him some more, instead of going into a department store (where you get the ones he has).. I opted for Amazon. Overall great selection but ended up going with these for the 3 pack. He LOVES them! He said the quality felt better, not as much of a compress but still does the trick!"
1071,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars I LOVE IT! Going to order another!!
1072,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good enough that I've brought it 3 times. They are simply awesome for workouts. The thin material is a little overwhelmed by larger amounts of sweat, not not quite perfect for a high intensity workout.<br />As far as their appearance, their tightness does a better job of smoothing things out than hiding real problem areas. There's only so much a top can do."
1073,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Look like gymshark They look very nice! I love them!
1074,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Very comfortable Very nice fabric and fit. I generally wear a small/medium top. 130lbs, 5'2"", fit but not athletic build. I purchased a medium desiring a more loose fit and arm exposure. Great soft fabric. Runs larger than your regular size"
1075,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,Get them!!! Fit good better to wear when it's cold but cool
1076,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Fits very tight Comfortable but it is definitely SNUG!  Based on this, i would have ordered 2 sizes bigger...."
1077,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Thanks Perfect fix
1078,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Super comfy I bought a large and it was a perfect fit.
1079,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"I love the material of this product and you can't beat ... I love the material of this product and you can't beat the price.  The only tricky part is figuring out your size and how it fits.  I like that it's fitted, but the length of the shirt down my torso was a little short.  For example, when I raise my hands above my head to reach for something, it rides up and a little of my tummy is exposed.  I normally wear a US size L if it is women's sizing.  If adult sizing, a medium and sometimes small if I like it more fitted.  I ordered the US XL size for this shirt and I think next time I'd go for the XXL if they have one.<br /><br />I use mines for playing tennis in the sun as it wicks moisture from my skin as well as gives me some sun protection without having to wear sunscreen on my arms.  I also use the sleeves to wipe the sweat from my forehead and it evaporates from the material very quickly.  I am happy with my purchase and I would order it again if they have an XXL size."
1080,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Muy comodos. Me gustaron mucho estos pantalones usualmente soy talla M pero compre la talla L y me quedo perfecto estan muy comodos din duda comprare otro par.
1081,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Nice quality, fresh Excellent, very fresh"
1082,5,B0B16Q1854,1,They were great They are my lazy Sunday comfortable sweats and they are awesome
1083,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars greet product
1084,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Exactly What I Wanted I literally wanted a plain grey hoodie, and that's exactly what I got.  The size is spot on, and it washes really well. It's warm, and the hood is a good size.  Fits comfortably under a jacket, but also nice enough to wear on its own."
1085,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Stylish and comfy Very comfy, I ordered a medium and it works great for a maternity shirt as well! There is lots of room and let’s a lot of air to come in.<br />I’m 5’5 and weight 150 because of the pregnancy and have lots of room in it still. Great for exercising too!"
1086,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Excellent quality and comfortable.
1087,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfy and a bit Lighter than I thought. Goes great under my Chelsea Jersey. Very comfortable and a bit lighter than I thought but thats a good thing. Its not for standing in a stadium...its for me drinking at the bar watching soccer.
1088,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love Well made, comfortable and the straps are adjustable. I love it so much that I bought the Carolina blue as well!!!"
1089,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great product Great product
1090,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great fit This is a PERFECT Gymshark doupe. The waist band is not too tight at the waist but tight enough to suck everything in.
1091,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Quality sweatshirt Nice sweatshirt
1092,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"amazing fit LOVE THE SHIRTS, first day wearing it to the gym and everybody was already telling me i look massive in the shirt."
1093,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"It’s very very comfy, and warm. I got 4xl even though I’m medium. I like over size in hoodies. Fits very large for me. Witch I like, very comfy."
1094,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Work shirts The shirts fit good
1095,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great value Grandson loved these shirts says it makes his body stand out
1096,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Go for it! These are better than I expected. Good quality and definitely remind my of gymshark.
1097,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Great hoodie Great hoodie with good price!!!
1098,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I't was my size, but... I take a Large, but Russell's large is pretty long.  Didn't like the way it looked.  I hate giving Russell just four stars because I've been a Russell fan for over a decade.  I would advise potential customers to still give it a try, though.  Can't hurt!"
1099,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Quality Fits as expected. Quality product.
1100,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Se ven muy lindos Muy bonito y comodo
1101,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Buy theses!! I never write reviews and I buy a ton on Amazon. These are amazing pants! I purchased two pair and will be adding more colors. The fit is perfect. I got XS, weigh 110lb and 5”4Q’. These aren’t too baggy or too tight. I wear them in all weather-90 degree days no problem. I have not worked out in these but guess they would be fine. For the price they are a fantastic find!!"
1102,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Satisfecha con la orden Suaves y justo ala medida
1103,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable & warm. Fits perfectly. I am 6'2"" & 275 lbs & the XXL fits just fine with plenty of room for comfort."
1104,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Exceeds Expectations for the Price It's inexpensive but not cheap. The hoodie is what you want on a winter day on the couch or a cold morning jog. It's oversized and warm and well-made. This is not some fashion hoodie. It's pure comfort. They run a size large, which is great. Again-that's comfort hoodie size. I love this hoodie."
1105,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Received Thank you.
1106,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good One High quality hoodie, thick and well made."
1107,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love love this dress Love love this dress. I wear a size 12-14 and ordered a large. Fits beautifully, love the adjustable shoulder straps. I wear a 40c bra and have plenty of room. The material is lightweight and flows beautifully. I couldn't be more happy only wish the seller had more choices."
1108,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Really great price and quality for three tops!!! I really loved these tank tops... great quality, love the fabric because it doesnt show sweat and breathes, and has a very flattering fit. Wish they were slightly longer... but I kind of have a long torso I guess. I got size medium and they fit great: I'm 5'8"", approx 155lbs. I'll probably buy more in different colors :)"
1109,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"We followed others advice. . . We followed the other reviews and took the Large instead of XL.  What great advice, because the Large fits perfect on the XL fellow.  He loves it! We got the purple and its such a beautiful, bright color.  Goes great with jeans."
1110,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Love these So comfy and perfect for travel gym or relaxing!
1111,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Looks great! Looks good on.
1112,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love it!! Absolutely love it ! I ordered the biggest size to make sure it fits so lose like the picture is showing and it works! The fabric is super soft and no sweats at all. I get a lot of compliments for the dress.<br />Absolutely worth the money ❤️
1113,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great for the price Good material for the price, wish the hood itself was a little smaller tho."
1114,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute dress Super cute. Saw a girl at work with it on in black. Bought blue so we wouldn’t match. Great dress.
1115,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love this! LOVE this - it's comfy rayon and the style is flattering on a figure where you want to hide your flaws. The only con is I think the size is great but it runs a tad tight in the bust. On me it's tight enough that I won't be wearing a bra which is okay becuase I bought this for lounging or just running to the grocery, etc. I ordered the extra large and I wear a size 16-18 if that helps. Again, the only place to be concerned is the chest. It comes folded and wrinkled but it steams out beautifully. Again, this is my favorite fabric. I always buy skirts or anything made of this type of rayon. It hangs beautifully on the body."
1116,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Very comfy Didn’t realize how low the arm holes were but i love the tank!
1117,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell Men's Dri Power Fleece Crewneck I like this sweatshirt.  Very comfortable.  Buy a size larger and shrink it once in a hot drier.  Just like all sweatshirts.
1118,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,squat proof very comfortable and squat worthy
1119,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Good for work in the sun Nice shirt to work in the sun
1120,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Comfortable and Great Price Being plus size I am always weary of buying clothes online. I decided that since it was cheap I would try it out. It actually fit great and was amazingly soft and comfortable. I normally wear a 26/28 and ordered the 5X.
1121,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"The shirts fit like I expected them to and they seem to be ... Honestly no complaints. The shirts fit like I expected them to and they seem to be of decent quality. i'm not blown away or anything, but they're good shirts"
1122,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Cómodas y prácticas Buenas
1123,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Quality Great product
1124,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Gym It’s great!!
1125,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Very comfortable.
1126,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars soft and comfortable fits just right 5 star material
1127,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Good value good product I wear these during workouts. I like having the hood as it increases the sweat factor. These are a good product, they fit appropriately and are wearing well after many washings."
1128,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Awesome! Awesome colors, super soft, and great fit!"
1129,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love them! These are some of my favorite under shirts or work out shirts!! I love that you can use them for either! Will be buying again for sure in the future!
1130,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits as expected The brand is so good and material is also really good. I keep buying these in different colors. I love these shirts. Im medium and it fits how i like but if you want it like super tight go one size down.
1131,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Super cómodas, frescas y con estilo! Para alguien gordito como yo, no tendrá problema en usar su talla normal y verse bien. Es muy ligera y suave la tela, es perfecta para hacer cualquier deporte.<br />Super recomendada!"
1132,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great fit/best for workout I really liked the way these fit, however on one of the shirts, there is a little extra material that hangs over. The other 2 shirts fit very well."
1133,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great Buy I am usually a small but I sized up due liking extra room. I am happy with the quality and fit. Would purchase again in every color.
1134,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love it I like the fit of this zip hoodie. It keeps me warm on chilly days and is good as a jacket on mild weather days. The quality of this hoodie is great. Washed it a few times and the color is not fading nor is the stitching deteriorating.
1135,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Perfect I wear these working out and when playing golf. They’re perfect
1136,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good hoodie for the price.. Its was a good item..fit well and warm for winter and early spring..wouldn't be good for later in the spring because it is so warm...
1137,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,How to look best in whatever top you wear !  
1138,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not really long, but I am 6' so.... I really like these tanks, but they aren't that long. Of course I'm very tall, so that may be the issue =)"
1139,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great price, awesome quality! Perfect fit! Lightweight, and keeps me dry! Love how the material feels on my super sensitive skin. Very breatheable! Such an incredible price for the quality!"
1140,5,B009R09Z8W,1,La calidad del producto Todo bien
1141,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love it! Loved the material and the color.
1142,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Most comfortable sweat/lounge pants and stylish too! Love these!! Perfect fit, super comfortable at an affordable price. I bought 5 other pair in different colors!"
1143,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great shirt My husband really loves these shirts. The have lasted us for awhile and have not shrunk or lost its texture or color. Good quality.
1144,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Ok
1145,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Reviews were helpful Reading the reviews were helpful because people were saying this is not a compression top. I would consider it a fitted top and it works for what I expected.
1146,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Buy Please make more colors ! These r my favorite leggings . I have a run of gymshak clothes and they all disappoint. These dupes are half price and are better than gymshak
1147,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Sweatshirt! Nice Middle/Heavy weight sweatshirt!  Many these days have sleeves that are too short while the sleeves on this one are just right....Nice to find a well fitting sweatshirt!!
1148,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,SO GOOD LOVE these leggings! Bought them in three other colors. Squat proof and so high rise that you can just wear with a sports bra without even revealing much skin.
1149,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Nice -- fit true to size, contrary to what I read I normally wear a medium, and I ordered an extra large based on what I read in the reviews.  It is definitely large on me.  The large should have been fine, and I'm guessing the medium would have been fine, too.  It's a light t-shirt material and has a nice flow to it."
1150,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Love it Very comfortable
1151,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great undershirts Stretchy tight fit but love it. Great undershirt
1152,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Sizing issue otherwise pretty comfy I usually wear medium ordered med but wish I got large
1153,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Happy with my purchase 🖤❤️ In love with these! I’m going to order more! They are comfy and make my butt look great. They aren’t as tight as yoga pants which I thought would be an issue but I was completely fine with it. They fit perfect and I love the fact that they have pockets!!! Definitely recommend them. FYI I ordered medium
1154,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Satisfied! Loving these shirts. Finally a workout shirt that’s of decent quality!!!
1155,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Excelente Excelente producto!
1156,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Best crewneck! Love this crewneck and the quality of sweatshirt is more than asking price. If you want oversized feel order size up. Not stuff and not flimsy. Able to layer. Would be perfect for personalizing too.
1157,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"These are awesome! Love these leggings! They’re super comfortable, flattering, and fit as expected. I’m picky about my gym clothes but these pass the test. Great to lift in. Already ordered more colors."
1158,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great sweatshirt Fits very good on my husband he loves it so much it keeps him nice and warm! The color looks cute too, we got the green one."
1159,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,As advertised. Love the product. This product is lightweight and pulls the water off of you while you train.  Love it.
1160,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Value I normally wear XXL shirts but ordered XL in these and they fit great. I wear them for work and will be buying more when I wear them out.
1161,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Plain Hoody super comfortable Easy to care for, my son loves that it's so comfy, also size is accurate to the manufacturers listed sizes."
1162,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Soft and comfy Very comfortable and was surprised with the great quality. Was just looking for something warm and to layer, but these are so cute to put on with jeans and for cool night and for anything 😊 very well fitted 👍"
1163,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"while this dress doesn't fit me like the picture Prefect summer dress. I'm a full figured lady, while this dress doesn't fit me like the picture, it's super cute for my body type. I've never gotten more compliments on an outfit before. The fabric is a soft cotton, not see through at all, but not heavy. It's prefect for hot days. I plan on buying other colors."
1164,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Work pants So comfortable
1165,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Nice fit I like how the shirts fit and no problems with sweating.
1166,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Warm and cozy These sweatshirt is so comfortable and warm. I may purchase more in the future.
1167,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great quality Fit my son perfect who is a thin build and 5'10&#34;
1168,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Really love these seamless leggings This review is for the Vital 2.0 leggings in the dark coffee marl and brown marl.  I’m 5’7”, approx 130lbs, give or take a few lbs.  Upon initial try-on, I thought they may be a little tight, but I worked out in them and really liked how they stayed up, waistband didn’t roll down, and they were just super flattering.  Just to do a test, I bought the lighter brown marl in size medium and that size was super comfy but the waistband rolled and there was some bunching in the front.  So if you are close to my height and weight, around a size 4-6, def get a size small.<br /><br />That being said, I have three pairs of seamless leggings from a different brand, all costing around 65.00 each, and Aoxjox has totally knocked it out of the park with the stretchy fabric, flattering fit, and awesome price.  I would much rather wear the Aoxjox seamless leggings than the others that I own, hands down.  As soon as they make more colors, like dark purple, dark teals or greens, I will be rushing to buy them.<br /><br />After having worn the dark coffee marl and then the lighter brown color, I found the dark coffee to show sweat (but I AM at the gym to work hard and sweat, so...) and the lighter brown didn’t show anywhere near as much.<br /><br />Both colors and sizes were squat proof.<br /><br />As far as laundering goes, I washed them in lukewarm water, gentle cycle, and turned them inside out.  Hung to dry.  They came out perfect.<br /><br />If you made it to this point in the review, I highly recommend the Vital 2.0 seamless leggings!  Buy at least one pair right now!"
1169,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Right size; Love the product and quality Good quality material. Too bad they sent one size larger than what i ordered....<br />- Ok. Received the large. loved them so i ordered a medium for comparison. It gives a tighter fit as expected but still lots of stretch. The large fit best - lays nicely. all are  very comfy. Material and craftsmanship are still excellent. So, I upgraded to five stars."
1170,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Shirts make you look flawless! Love these shirts! Makes me look good and fits so comfortable. On the days of upper body, you must put on these T’s. It will give you an motivation to work those body parts just the way they show in these tshirts. Love it"
1171,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Perfect Fit and Material Fit and material perfect. One of the best purchases on Amazon. Quick shipping too. Would order again.
1172,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great quality as well~ I ordered this and got this within a day!<br />Great quality as well~
1173,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Perfect little girls dress Love the dress very light weight and vibrant patterns. The kids loved them
1174,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,The best Unbelievably fantastic. Everything about these leggings is perfect.
1175,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"For the price it'd be hard to find better I think The material is comfortable, and light."
1176,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Nicely made and great price I needed these for my 5 mile walks and hiking trips.  The dry fit material works well.  They run very small.  I wear a S or M, and got a large, which worked out for me."
1177,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Nice tank, terrible shipping Nice tank. Seems to run a little big. Great item, terrible shipping and customer service by prime. Promised 2 day delivery turned into 4. When i chatted he just kept parroting back what I said and telling me he understands yet no compensation.  Amazon is growing into other areas and their service and customers suffer."
1178,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Perfect fit I love these leggings. The quality feels nice, although I’ve noticed some inseam string dangling. I get a lot of compliments and they frame the body extremely well. I’m 5’4”, 139 lb and I got a small"

1185,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Nice material, but runs small Nice thin fabric, form fitting, but runs quite small.  I normally wear a large, and their XL is so small it is almost doesn't fit."
1186,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Fits very nice. Fits nicely. I’m 5’1 and 127lbs and was worried it won’t fit or be to tight but it’s actually perfect. I’m glad it’s not tight too. The fabric is not see through but if stretched it would be so.
1187,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Perfect pants My pant fit just comfortable the way I wanted them to fit. The thickness is perfect. I've only wore one pair when it was raining, and they kept me nice and dry."
1188,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love these! These leggings are some of the best gym leggings I've had! They are super comfy and they look really great on me! I like the ombre design and the compression isn't too much that it is uncomfortable but they stay up during workouts. I can't wait to buy more of these!

1195,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Every day Wear!! I wear one of these style shirts everyday. Way better than the A type (wife beater) shirts! I have always wore an undershirt since I can remember. Probably passed 20 years or so. Since finding these, only under shirts I wear now!! Highly recommended!!! Very comfortable"
1196,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Fantastic dress to have on hand! This dress is so comfortable! It is extremely lightweight and has a low v neck if that is of concern to you. Easy to layer with a camisole. The pockets on this dress are Everything! Got so many compliments while wearing. Highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe!

1199,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"Fit well, because adjustable. I particularly like the fact that these are long enough for me at 5’10”.<br />They have an elastic waist as well as being adjustable. They are not a thick material. This is my 3rd pair & the others washed fine."
1200,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Very nice Fits nice and is adorable.
1201,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Best bang for the buck [[VIDEOID:f1d4b219aa4b610fe0ebfc21636c2a10]] One of my favorite gym shirts now. You cannot beat the price. Dry fit, lightweight, jersey mesh like material. I am 6 foot 1 inch and 225 pounds. In the video I am 28% body fat. I ordered US XL (EU XXL). Fits great. I might prefer it to be a bit longer but as I work down to 15% body fat it will hang lower so I am ok with the current fit. There are several other “brands“ But they are essentially the exact same shirt."
1202,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Right for fall weather Loved the quality of material..loved the fit
1203,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Fits greats! Very Comfortable

1208,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Love My Polka-Doted Dress Worn for 2 summer and still get compliments.
1209,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,BEST JOGGERS EVER I literally bought 3 pairs of these. They are high waisted and fit my booty just right. They are great for tennis in the winter bc of their sizable pockets for balls. The only small fault is they are a bit short b my bc I am 5’11 but anyone under 5’9” it should go to your ankle.
1210,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Beautiful dress I love this dress. Enough weight to make it hang nicely and the color is great. I will wear this on a fall day with a light weight sweater as well as the summer months.

1216,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,if you are size L you might want to go one size up! Hubby said product feels good but he always wears a large and the large here is too tight. So I am sending the Large back and ordered XL hopefully they will fit better.

1218,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great fit and comfort Super comfortable
1219,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great product! It is not easy to find compression tank tops for men who are big in a muscular way. These are awesome and reasonably priced too.  Highly recommend
1220,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Love them! The fabric is stretchy and comfortable. The only thing I didn’t like was the word ‘compression’ because it doesn’t really compress anything haha. Other than that they are perfect!
1221,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Love it
1222,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great Exactly what I was looking for. I've worn it under my scrubs for work and sometimes just for working out, it's fantastic for both. I'll likely be ordering more in the future."

1231,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"""value"" hoodie I like this hoodie.<br />I got it during Cyber Monday discount season. So, you may not get it as discounted.<br />But it's a good hoodie for discounted price.<br />One small thing is that it's texture of fabric is rough. I mean really rough. Wish it was softer"
1232,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Comfortable pretty dress Pretty pattern, comfortable, nice cool material! I wear this over a tee! Have gotten compliments! Appears well made, love that it has adjustable shoulder straps and pockets! I’m 5/3 1/2, 150 lbs, 67 y/o, I don’t feel that this is too young for me! Ordered the XL, I don’t like my clothes clingy, so a L probably would have fit! I got the pretty red and black flowers with some green and white in the pattern! Great price!"
1233,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Perfect for workouts Perfect for working out with deep enough pockets to hold my phone

1237,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfectly flattering and flowy with pockets! This dress just arrived and I love it! I’m 5’5”, 190 pounds, size 16 and I ordered an XL. I intend to wear it with a bralette and the fit is just right. The straps adjust so that the arm holes are not too loose. The top fits great and the dress is so perfectly flowy that is flatters. It doesn’t cling and it is not see through. Fabric is soft and flowy. I plan to hand wash and hang dry just to be safe, but I love it enough to order in other colors."
1238,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Pretty dress Grandkids love it
1239,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Perfect fit! Amazing

1243,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Good fit and comfortable! Love these joggers, really comfortable and true to size.  I'm a medium in most things and these fit well."
1244,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Correct Fit This shirt is heavy like a sweat shirt should be and it has a loose fit and not tight like a polo shirt.  It is a quality shirt.
1245,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,BUY THESE NOW Love these so comfortable perfect exactly what I wanted
1246,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Hoodie This is a good hoodie. It's comfortable and has decent stretch. I usually like my goodies in large but the medium I purchased fits very good. Definitely worth the money.
1247,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good general guide to the national Forests. good bargain Good fit, nice color, good price."

1250,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Great for a cruise dress The fit is great. Printed pattern is vivider than the photos from amazon, which is prettier."
1251,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great value. I needed a comfortable hoodie to work in my yard for collecting fall leaves......then later for colder temps to wear under a heavier winter jacket for added warmth.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I love it and ordered a second one almost immediately.<br /><br />Be aware there’s a lot of fuzz or lint on the inside so a wash  might be advisable before wearing.  Also on the third wash I noticed a bit of pilling but that was fine with me since I’m wearing it for chores mainly.<br /><br />I recommend the hoodie without hesitation.
1252,5,B09M6X79V9,1,The side u want Perfect colors👌
1253,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Cómodas para entrenar Muy buen diseño
1254,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Fit is as expected As described
1255,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Love these shirts.  Very comfortable.
1256,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Solid I’m a 6ft 167~lb guy, not a “jacked” build. I wear a medium in every other shirt I own/would buy, I bought a medium in these. The length is fine, the waist fit is loose but it doesn’t hang that much, it does feel breathable and looks alright. The side cuts don’t show much, and my nipples aren’t about to pop out. Your results may vary though if you’re jacked and go for a smaller size then like an “average” fit."
1257,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Run super small but comfy! They’re really flattering but run small. Im 5’4 & 150lb, small up top- I carry my weight in my bottom half and the larges were very snug!!! I could’ve gone with an XL."
1258,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Not a Maxi dress. This is not a maxi dress! I got mine and it is adorable. But it came just below my knees. I am 5&#34;7 and I ordered a medium, navy with polka dots. I ended up just tying it in a know in the front and it looks cute still."
1259,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Great Great, comfortable and durable"
1260,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Cute dress! Cute dress, fits fine"
1261,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Exactamente Excelente producto
1262,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Love them I absolutely love these. My only gripe is the first pair I bought didn’t have pockets as expected so I was a bit disappointed by that but these are my new favorites.
1263,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Light and comfortable I am 5'8.5, athletic build. I ordered a small. My weight is anywhere from 135-145. This dress is roomy, I could wear a XS if they had it, but sthee straps are adjustable which makes for a perfect fit. I now own 2 of these dresses. The  black/white polka dot & the red floral. The<br />white  flowers in the pattern is very small creating a nice look. The dress is soft, flowy and not see through at all. I wore daisy's on my breast and nude no show lazer cut under wear. Can dress up or down.  The dress feels very freeing."
1264,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice Great colors and fit.

1270,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,nice fabric - runs larger than expected overall was too big
1271,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,I got two of these because I like them! Great fit and soft material
1272,4,B076QD9NP1,1,Super cute and comfy - size runs big. Perfect for my daughters pet adoption birthday party! She loved it! Though it runs a little big. She’s a petite 5 year old and the 3-4 was a little big on her.

1276,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Buy one size larger than you think you need I thought the material would be a little thicker, but it's great for mild fall days. Manufacturing quality is very good."
1277,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Love it. Buying another 3.
1278,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Pretty Dress Beautiful bright red, fabric is a little thin which isn't a bad thing out in the hot sun. Overall the dress is cute and feminine."
1279,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Too small and short I’m sure for others they would fit perfectly. However, they were too small for me and they were too short. I need a longer cami"
1280,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Extremely nice - slightly tight I am 5'11"" 215lbs. Ordered size Large. The shirts are a nicer design than expected. Very nice quality, especially at the price point. Fit is ever so slightly tighter than expected. If you like some room in the mid section go up a size."
1281,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Awesome workout leggings! Amazing workout leggings. They really compress for a tucked in and flattering look. No rolling down and they keep their shape. I bought a few colors.
1282,4,B09M6X79V9,1,It was too tight Love the colors. But still fit too tight
1283,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Very good deal! Excellent item. All ate soft and sizing is correct. I ordered 4 and my husband loves them!
1284,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"May want to size down I have a few pair of these in other brands. They are so, so, so comfortable. These do run a bit big. I wish I would have sized down, but I still really enjoy them."
1285,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Cheap price for a good product They fit pretty well
1286,5,B0B16Q1854,1,"A must buy when the price is right. The size was just right! The most comfiest sweatpants that I own. In fact, I bought another pair."

1290,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Hoodie! It's a little bigger than I expected, but it is way heavier and warmer, too! I'm very happy with this purchase!"
1291,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Lo recomiendo 100% Excelente producto igual a lo observado
1292,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"MUST BUY! Amazing! OMG this leggings is EVERYTHING!!!!  100% squat proof, very soft and perfect lenght. I’m 5”2, 140lb and ordered SMALL. Fits as expected. Can’t say enough about them and definitely will be buying more sizes"
1293,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Sweater Bought this about a month ago and since then I have used it pretty much everyday.  I've used it while travelling, working out, and sleeping because it's comfortable. I also own a Hanes sweater that is very similar but super lightweight and flimsy compared with the Russell. The &#34;Dri-Power&#34; technology is second to none and doesn’t leave you with a nasty smell after heavy sweat laden workouts.<br /><br />This hoodie has a great weight to it and does a fantastic job at keeping me very warm! The draw string on the hood is super long so you don’t have to worry about it getting stuck in the hood and the front pocket is adequate enough but I don’t place more than a few napkins in it for fear of something falling out with me noticing its gone.<br /><br />Now, to the size, if you were a big person with wide shoulders then I’d recommend one size bigger. However, if your shoulders are not broad then go with a size smaller than your normal size. This thing runs very big and sometimes I feel like I’m swimming in mine. I’m 5’9 245 lbs., so by no means am I a tiny guy.<br /><br />Overall it runs big and stays dry and is very comfortable and has held up very well through all the sweat and washing I have put it through, which in my opinion speaks volumes about the reliability and quality of material and stitching.<br /><br />Russell Athletic FTW<br />It worked for Rocky and definitely works for me!"
1294,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Russell Athletic are well made and always comfortable. Just what I expected from Russell Athletic.
1295,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,buena compra Calidad precio calidad precio es un buen producto. El material se ve  mejor en las foto pero esta bien
1296,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Buy them! These are literally amazing!!!! So comfortable, so cute and fits like a glove.<br />I got my usual medium. Sometimes I’m between sizes depending on brand, but I found the medium fit best on me since I’m more bottom heavy.<br />We love dupes 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 100000% buy them!"
1297,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love it Looks flattering
1298,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars The person I got this for loves it.
1299,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Perfect hoodie all around!! I loved that it matched perrrfect with my shoes I wanted it for!! I love that its warm but light weight so I'm able to wear it with a tee or cami without it being too much or too hot. Have ordered 7 other colors as well!! I love my hoodies!!
1300,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Five Stars Great fit, comfy and not to tight"
1301,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great product Good deal!
1302,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Listened to other reviews...get one size down... very comfortable.. Get Large if you normally get XL...runs large but one size down.. perfect.
1303,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Comfortable leggings, Stayed up during running and hot yoga! Comfortable high waist leggings perfect for high intensity workouts. They stay put so I’m not constantly adjusting them! Excellent customer service also!!"

1305,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Five Stars Meets my expectations in every way: fit, comfort, appearance.  I'll be buying another one in the future."
1306,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I recommend a size small because the medium looks baggy and ... I am 145 pounds and 5'7 tall, and I ordered a Med so if anyone around the same size as I am, I recommend a size small because the medium looks baggy and big on me, but still warm and does the job."
1307,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great joggers! Soft lightweight joggers. Loved so much I bought more!
1308,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great gym gear These are great for gym time!! Need to be available in 3x

1310,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Super cute. The sizing runs a little big Super cute.  The sizing runs a little big.
1311,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Really nice I would recommend this dress. Tru to size. You take it out of the package, put it on and keep doing whatever you were doing."
1312,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Pleasantly surprised that 2XL fit me Ordered XL but received 2XL.  Thought they were going to be too large but to my surprise they fit like I wanted them to.
1313,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Best Joggers - Silky Soft Material, Unbeatable Fit, Easy to Wash & Dry I am OBSESSED with these joggers! I ordered them in 3 other colors after trying them. They are incredible with regard to a very comfortable weight that isn’t too hot, but I wore them to run outside in 40 degree weather today & wasn’t cold. I just had a baby a month & half ago & love the feel of the high waist. So flattering, even with my tummy. (I had a C section with my first & this was my second baby.) I don’t ever have to tug or pull on them, they are always comfortable. The material is so soft, I hardly want to take them off. I have thrown them in the washer & dryer & they have come out looking brand new. I fit in a large fine, but liked the extra roominess in the leg & waist of the extra large. Photo is of extra large size. I am 5’6 1/2” & weigh about 200 lbs."
1314,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Better Than Expected I wear these for running. While not the softest material it does dry quick and has been a staple in my running wardrobe. Again not my favorite but they work.
1315,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Fits perfect The size is accurate and it fit perfect.....
1316,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,True to size.  Very nice Love this sun dress.  Just bought another one different color - you won’t be disappointed
1317,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"is good for the summer It is soft,is good for the summer ,and for me for the four seasons"
1318,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"great quality and as comfortable as I wished for on ... Fits perfectly, great quality and as comfortable as I wished for on this old body. Thank you !"
1319,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Love this! Will get in more colors! I ordered a small, it fit perfectly. I wore shape wear just because I have a mom pudge, but it would have been fine without also."
1320,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Love my new shirts I use them for a second layer under my clothes in the cooler weather
1321,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Best tank!! Won’t be disappointed I literally have everyone of my friends in the gym ordering these! They are the best fit!!
1322,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good fit Good fit
1323,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Runs a little big Great tank tops for the price, very soft and comfortable but they do tend to run a little big."
1324,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Very satisfied. I hoped it wouldn't be too long, but it was. I'm very shirt, though, so had to hem it. Otherwise  I love this dress."
1325,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Sweatshirt Like it.
1326,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"GOOD VALUE Attractive, lightweight, fashionable style....worth the reasonable price!"
1327,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits perfectly I liked how the workout shirts looked on my husband. They are very nice and fits him perfectly
1328,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Puuurfect 😊 Exactly as pictured! Very cute and brightly colored! Very happy with it.
1329,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love this dress Fits great, well made, attractive!  Love the pockets and adjustable straps.  Great buy!"
1330,4,B0B16Q1854,1,Happy to have Thought the elastic  would be tight  around the ankle but was not which makes it much nicer.
1331,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Excellent fit! Excellent fit!! I'm a little pudgy around the midsection. And those of us who have that issue until you lose weight understand what I am saying. Wearing the Sweatshirt gives you more flexibility even after washing.
1332,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Best Joggers Ever!! I have ordered 2 pairs so far. They both feel amazing. The material is the quality of LuluLemons, which I have a large collection of their products. I was so surprised to find these joggers are just as high quality for way less price."
1333,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Size up I’m normally a large and I’m glad I listened to the reviews saying to size up because they are tighter the XL fits like a large, other then that it’s really nice quality, I would buy again"
1334,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Great quality for the price! I was very surprised with the quality of this dress! It is a nice soft fabric that isn't too thin or too thick. Very happy!
1335,4,B09M6X79V9,1,I bought the medium and it fit's perfectly! Love the way this tank feels..I bought the 3 pk. And wore the blue one first. It was very lightweight and comfortable.
1336,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Looks more like a nice sweater than a sweatshirt I love these sweatshirts. They look more like a sweater than a sweatshirt. The colors are beautiful. I wear them a lot. I’m trying to get a sweatshirt in each color offered. I highly recommend them.
1337,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Five Stars Nice
1338,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great tank Great non-restricting workout tank
1339,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Nice Very nice fit and very comfortable.
1340,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Adequite and a Little Small It's a nice hoodie. It is too small to wear over anything thicker than a t-shirt.
1341,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Comfy outfit for summer Good dress overall. I’m short 4’ 11-1/2” and the straps aren’t as sturdy or adjustable as much as I’d like them to be but I managed to still make it work.
1342,4,B09M6X79V9,1,But all in all its nice an thin an comfortable lightweight an the strech in ... Ok so i went off the reviews an ordered a larger size i normally wear a large so i bought a xl an needless to say i should have just ordered the large bc its alil bit to big an lose fitting to be a compression tanktop for working out. So in all honesty its true to size i think !!! But all in all its nice an thin an comfortable lightweight an the strech in it is made well !!!!
1343,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Our favorite brand This is my family's sweatshirt brand of choice.  They are roomy, comfortable and flattering.  This order was a men's 3xL.  It is a comfortable loose fit for my brothers 6' 250 pound frame.  The fabric is a nice medium weight.  Washes well.  We own several that we've had five years or more; still lookin good."
1344,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Very nice. Loved these sweats.
1345,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great Buy! I received this within the 2 days, as expected.  My husband will use this for work.  The fit is just right and it is nice and thick, which is what I was looking for.  I will be purchasing several more of these!"
1346,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Four Stars good product. I wish they were longer.
1347,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Everything as described. Comfortable and breathing.
1348,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"These shirts are great! I have used these shirts for lifting weights for almost a year now and they still fit as good as they day I got them. I workout 6 days a week, and wear these at least 4 of them. They do get hair caught in them in the washer, other than that they are great."
1349,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Nice & comfortable & just what I was looking for
1350,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars These are great tanks to wear underneath other shirts.  Very slimming but the white is see through.
1351,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Niccce Very breathable with sleek design will be purchasing more clothing
1352,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Its not dryfit material Nice shirt, pretty decent quality, looks nice, but the only thing one of the letters in Logo on the back of the shirt was kinda faded but other than that good product."
1353,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,best leggings ever seriously the best leggings I own. completely squat proof and super comfortable!!! I bought them in 5 colors
1354,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Perfect fit and great look Perfect fit and great look.  Also rapid-fast delivery!
1355,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Great shirts for great price. Perfect for what I needed and you can't beat the price. I'm 5'4"" and 120. I always wear a small and I ordered a small. This shirt fits close to the body and arms but not tight. The arms are just the right length and I could pull them down over my hands on a chilly run if I needed to."
1356,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Love these fit great and works as described
1357,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,love it Soft cotton. Very attractive
1358,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"pretty much want one in every color I've never bought into any overly stereotypical gym guy gear to avoid being &#34;that guy&#34;. But I went out on a limb and bought these. I have no regrets, I dont know how they did it, but I feel like i look great in these.<br /><br />functionally: they are super breathable and lightweight, but dont stretch so much."
1359,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Ok for the price The colors are vibrant. They make me sweat more than normal. They don’t fit as tight as I’d expected but the material is nice.
1360,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,Very cute - light weight for working out! I liked this tank - I work out a lot and wanted something comfy and cute to add to my already decent workout tank wardrobe 👍. This shirt fits just like I was hoping - I will wear a spaghetti strap tank under it -but that’s just me.  It can definitely be worn over a sports bra for a little edgier look but still there’s plenty of middle coverage. I’m going to order more and in the same size which I thought was spot on.
1361,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fits well for small chest I'm 5'7 130 lbs and I bought the XS size. Fits perfectly without being too tight
1362,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great product Fits perfectly

1365,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love it extremely comfortable Beautiful color fits perfect everything I asked for
1366,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars its cool
1367,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Nice quality fabric, fits perfect These are so nice- the fabric is thick and gives me good compression. I ordered the white leggings and even though it says they’re not squat proof, in my opinion they look like they are.<br />I’m 5’6” and 135 lbs. I ordered the small and think it fits great. (It’s snug- but I like my leggings like that to shape my waist area)"
1368,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars The sweat shirt was perfect.
1369,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Es muy comoda Megusta
1370,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great quality Husband likes them a lot. Good quality, fits perfectly, colors great, washed & dried them - still the same, no shrinkage at all. Recommend to any one searching for good sweatshirts."
1371,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Excellent quality. Feel great and fit Nicely These are really great quality and feel very nice. You can tell they are made well and the stitching is nice. They are not too thick or too thin and hold up well after several washes and no problems with shrinking or getting fuzzy. I have ordered these several times now for personal use and as gifts and now I also include them in my store for orders made through my Etsy store for applying graphics and they work perfectly and the customers have been very happy with the quality of the product. The price is competitive  and sometimes found same price but this offers as prime also so i get free shipping and makes up the difference. I will continue to order these as need for my orders and personal use as well cause I love how they feel. I have one customer that request these specifically when i make her orders.
1372,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great service Great product
1373,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"LOVE LOVE this dress... Perfect for Atlanta HEAT!! This dress is fantastic...highly recommend it -I will buy another one or two... it is lightweight but heavy enough that you don't need to wear a bra and I am at least a size D...<br />Because of the tie string, you can have it as close to your armpit as possible which is a feature i like... it is in the first wash so will update if quality changes after first wash... but so far LOVE  it and is perfect for really hot days!"
1374,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love the way it looks and fits on me! I'm normally a small but between 2 kids my hips got wider. I bought small and it fits perfectly! The material is really soft and feels high quality. They are thicker than the cheaper gym pants which is awesome! I actually thought the leggings have little holes in them by looking at the photo but it's just a darker print design. I honestly love it. It's so different from the ones I own and I'm so glad I bought it! Looking forward to buying the other colors in the future!
1375,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Show me your guns My teen loves these tanks. Washed up great. Fit great.
1376,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Cute but too small. I’m a medium in all of my Amazon leggings but these felt very small on me. They are beautiful leggings so I may just exchange the size.
1377,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Favorite joggers One of my favorite pair of joggers. They are very comfy and cute. They are very flattering in the booth area. I am 5’8 178lbs and I got a large.

1393,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Great top! Love it! Favorite color and cut lines fit where I want them to!
1394,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,So COMFY & Squat Proof! I've been shopping around for seamless leggings that were squat proof and after reading the reviews this was a top contender. The color I purchased was the forest green ones and I love them!! They're a little more teal looking in person but they hold up to what all the reviews say and not to mention they're SUPER comfy to just lounge in. I don't really know about the other colors but if your looking for ones that are squat proof I would def try these!
1395,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"Good value! Purchased several dresses for my 6 year old granddaughter. She loves the cut, cute designs and comfort.  Dress is durable and holds up well to washing."
1396,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Leggings This workout leggings are better than my gum shark ones 🙌🙌

1401,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Love the fabric I haven’t really worn one of these yet, therefore my review can’t be complete, but I love the fabric of these, just what I was looking for to wear under other shirts on the golf course for warmth but not bulk. They have a nice silky feel. I’m not sure how they would be for working out in, but I imagine they might be a little too warm for that unless you were in a cool room."
1402,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Comfortable light weight, run slightly large Not real thick, light compression"
1403,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Runs small Comfortable, but I don't own any other size L shirts and only a few size M's. I also have a short torso. These are size L and they fit me but I almost think size XL would look more flattering."

1405,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Warm
1406,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Love the shirts, but size UP!! I LOVE these tanks, the quality is great and they are so soft! BUT I would say unless you like a tighter fit size UP! I bought a large which I usually wear (Im 5'2"" and 165 lbs) and they are too tight for my liking, like you can see your rolls :(  Otherwise love the shirts, I think they will look more flattering on me though once I lose the weight I want to lose!"

1426,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Warm, Fits well."
1427,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,LOVE THESE! I got a size that I would normally fit in joggers and they fit perfectly. I like mine to fit tighter around the bottom area and then a little loose fitting on the legs. I definitely will be buying more colors in these joggers. The material is sort of a thick legging material. Super comfy and high waisted!
1428,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfort Waist tends to ride up a little bit but still fits better than the Hanes counterpart I have in the same size and color.

1430,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice material! I love these tanks, they're very comfortable. A little more snug than I expected but they still fit, they're just meant to be form fit. The material is very comfortable and breathable. Great purchase. Wish their were more color and pattern options available though."

1432,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Sexy little summer dress Sexy little summer dress, or a swim cover up, stretchy material but not shiny, falls just a tad below my knees although I could tighten the straps to bring just above knees.

1436,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Not what I was expecting! 2/15/2017:  Update<br />This seller reached out to me after I left a review stating it wasn't what I expected as far as the large polka dots.<br />This dress is comfortable and I am able to dress it up or dress it down.  The dots are larger then expected, but other then that, thank you for this considerate seller who reached out to me to make sure I was happy with the product.  I will be purchasing from this seller again.<br /><br />A lot of material that feels nice on and love that there are pockets.  However, what's advertised is much much  smaller polka dots. What I received were big polka dots on a black background.  Ugh!!!!!!!"

1439,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Compression Questionable I purchased this item for compression for Lymphedema of the breast caused by radiation therapy after breast cancer. I didn't find these garments to have enough compression to help with this condition, however, they fit nicely. If I didn't need them for this condition, they are beautiful and fit well. I will keep them because I like the fit, but just didn't find them useful for a compression garment. - Lisa"
1440,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great shirt Great shirt, it fits close to my body but not tight . I normally wear a large shirt but decided to get a medium size based on what I saw from the other reviews .

1453,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Casually nice Fabric feels super comfy and effortless. Pockets are in a sensible spot (unlike some dresses that would require you to awkwardly shrug your shoulders while having your hands in the pockets) I'm 5'10&#34; and I like the length on me, so keep that in mind if you're shorter. I wore it with a jean jacket and sandals and really enjoyed how I felt all day. Glad to have found this, and I will wear it again and again."

1459,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,No more bloody nipples! I use these as undershirts for running (so no more raw nipples) and they work great!  Hold everything where it should and prevents chafing.  Couldn't ask for anything more.

I'm 5'10 and they fit where I would expect joggers to, as they are not too short (woot woot!!).  The quality is great and the color is accurate.  The clearly aren't going to keep me warm (in MN) but would be a great option for a 60*-80* day or to wear around the house."
1469,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Not what I expected but still good Definitely not a compression tank but still ok. They fit on the loose side and the material was a bit thin. Will probably just wear as a normal tank top for summer.
1470,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"Super comfy! I ordered this looking for a comfy but good quality hoodie and that's exactly what I got. I'm very petite, under 5 feet and about 105 and it fits as I expected. Slightly large but that's because I'm so small. It's super comfy and the quality is way better than I expected for a $10 hoodie. I have the vintage heather navy. I will definitely order some more!"
1471,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Very cute and comfortable.perfect beach dress.
1472,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Warm and perfect.
1473,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Very Comfy! Liked everything about these sweat pants!
1474,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Bellas Comodas
1475,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Best Sweatshirt Ever This is the second one I bought - and I can say that with proper care - mine still looks brand new and is so soft and warm! It is all comfy cozy and I would definitely buy more if I needed them. Mine is very large - so I cannot be sure of the sizing since I like mine to be very big and baggy and this does fit exactly as expected and I love the pink! Hard item to find especially in such large sizes!
1476,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Soft and comfortable Very soft and comfy
1477,5,B009R09Z8W,1,"Five Stars perfect fit, feels comfy, exactly as expected, great value for money"
1478,5,B009R09Z8W,1,This is a super comfortable sweatshirt...I love mine! This is not a lightweight or stretchy sweatshirt...it just fits right.
1479,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Super comfortable and fits perfectly Very comfortable and breathes really well.
1480,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Awesome tanks! Great Moisture wicking, can be worn as undershirt or to workout, long enough to tuck in."
1481,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Its super comfortable and gorgeous all in one This dress is absolutely beautiful!. I love the feel of the fabric and the way it naturally enhances my curves. It's definitely a favorite.
1482,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"LOVE these pants! 5'2"" 125 pounds, medium is perfect. With being on the shorter side I thought they may be too long but nope, perfect length too. Just received my first pair and I will definitely be purchasing more. Nice fabric, stretchy, has pockets with one on the inside of them in the back. Highly recommend these pants!"
1483,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,The beat gum shirt you’ll ever have! I have multiple colors and i love it! 180 lbs 5’9” athletic build and size large
1484,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"THESE ARE A YES, but.. FINAL UPDATE: The seller reached out to me about the year in the leggings. A replacement was sent free of charge and arrived very timely. Have not had any problems with the replacement or the other pairs I have.<br />Still recommend to friends and family & have plans to buy more! Love how they feel and look! 🥳<br /><br />UPDATE: I’ve had the leggings for about a month and a half and the teal ones are, unfortunately, ripping right now the middle. I’ve really loved them and the others are fine for now - but it’s really disappointing that they haven’t lasted long. I’ve only air dried them and wash them on a soft cycle.<br /><br />________________________________________<br />To preface: I am 145lbs, 5’8, bigger in the hips area with most of my height being in my legs.<br /><br />I ordered 5 pairs of these so far - 3 originally, 2 more a few days after.<br /><br />The first pairs ordered were: Forest Green Marl, Bright Red Marl and the Charcoal, size S.<br />I had to return the red because they were more see through than preferred (which was actually my fault. I didn’t read the provided info about that color being less squat proof). Overall, the fit is good! They were quite compressed and both the Forest and Charcoal were squat proof. Because of my long legs, both were about 2 inches above my ankles, which I don’t mind. Neither of them showed sweat for me, but my butt doesn’t really sweat much so... it’s hard to say for sure on that one.<br /><br />The two additional pairs purchased were: Indigo and Wine Red Marl, size M. (Different size mainly only becuse I was curious how they would fit compared to the S). They fit very similarly to the S! Still compressed, just slightly less, and still stopped about 2 inches above my ankles.<br /><br />However, the wine red were a little bit shorter than the other 3 pairs, both in how far above my ankles they stopped and even just holding them up to the other pairs. These ones stopped about 5 inches above my ankles, which I don’t really mind enough to return because they are still great leggings, just a bit shorter than the others - hence, the 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Otherwise, everything else was great. My return of the bright red pants was very simple and quick and am getting a full refund for them.<br /><br />I can also say, I teaterred for like 5 hours on what size I should get. The S and M both fit, the only difference is that the S fit a little bit tighter."
1485,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good fit The fit was just at the level of my waist it may shrink after first wash
1486,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Color is amazing. Love to fit! Love it!! The material is nice !! Can’t wait to wear it to my next workout.
1487,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Good quality My only complaint is that they don’t stay in place when working out. When doing HIIT or running, they fall down and gave me a diaper butt lol. They are squat proof, super soft, no camel toes, etc. just didn’t stay up. I’m a size 4-6 in jeans, I’m 5’10” and 155lbs And I ordered a medium"
1488,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Go one size down for actual compression I typically wear size large shirts. I saw someone else say to go a size down so I ordered size medium. I definitely agree to go a size down. I think if I ordered these in size large, it would be loose to be considered compression at all. Also, don't expect this to give a slimmer figure, this isn't a waist trainer."
1489,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Good buy I really like these.  They are great workout tanks and you can't beat the price.
1490,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Excelente chacheta Calidad, tanto que pedimos otra de otro color.  Algodon grueso y bien terminada."
1491,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Very comfortable. Perfect. Very comfortable. Perfect.
1492,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Would buy again Like
1493,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Cute dress! I Used this dress as a swimsuit cover up and it was perfect. The material was very light and comfortable. It ran a little long so I just tied a little knot at the ankle which actually made it look cuter!
1494,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Does the job right for right price. It doesn't hold off on the sweat amazingly but it does the job for my 2 to 4 hour sessions. I'm 5'7 and 145lbs and it fits perfect, considering I prefer a bit of a loose fit."
1495,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,BUY THESE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT These are THE BEST leggings I’ve ever bought. Very close to a gym shark dupe. So comfortable fit the body so so so well. And cannot beat the price. I have came back to buy them in every color.
1496,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Roomy feel but tapered, flattering look. Sturdy, but soft and roomy. Definitely a midweight sweatshirt, not skimpy like some are lately..."
1497,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars A perfect fit Quality is excellent.
1498,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great compression shirts! Great compression shirts! These work great as undershirts or for working out. Super lightweight and always keeps you feeling cool.
1499,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Exactly as ordered Makes a good light jacket
1500,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,My husband is 6 foot tall and 180 pounds. ... My husband is 6 foot tall and 180 pounds. The large top him very well. Material seems durable and it has been washed several times.
1501,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits Perfect Second one I bought. Always fit perfect
1502,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Optimistic, when I order a better size I am 5'8"" and approx 195lbs.  I wear a size large shirt comfortably.  These shirts fit more snug than I was expecting considering what I normally wear.  I do like the shirts, but I will likely order an xl this next time and update this from there.  As you can see from the picture, the material is breathable and I feel like it would hold up well to a good workout."
1503,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Nice tops, run a tad short I wear these under my work uniform every day and have had them for a few weeks now. They wash and dry easily with no problems. They wick sweat well and are comfortable. They are definitely stretchy and the material is substantial. I was really unsure of what size to buy based on reviews and went with medium as I want it to be tight under my uniform top. I am large chest 34F and smaller waste with large hips. This top fits me very well the only thing I would say is they are a tad on the smaller side but more so shorter in length. Luckily for me I have a short torso but if I would need more in the future I would buy a large, mostly just for additional length."
1504,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfortable Comfortable
1505,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Runs large This item runs big.
1506,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Very comfortable Very comfy and perfect undershirts. Not a compression shirt at all though
1507,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good quality Vert versatile
1508,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good material! I love these tanks. I wear them as undershirts, but by themselves sometimes, as well!!"
1509,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Four Stars Love it!
1510,4,B076QD9NP1,1,Four Stars Fits good! Nice and stretchy
1511,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"worth it I took a risk getting gray with a curvy bottom half and Im willing to wear these in public... thats a big deal for me and tells how flattering these are. Im just really self-conscious about my legs. Im 5'3, 155lbs, between 10 and 12 in jeans and I ordered Large and theyre perfect. Really great material. I'll probably get more colors soon."
1512,5,B097RFTKJP,1,"Beautiful Dress I love this dress!! It is very flattering, very comfortable and be dressed up or down.  It just flows for most occasions.  The color is beautiful!  The straps at the top allow you to adjust the fit in the chest.  It is knee length so it works with flats or heels."
1513,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Perfect fit Fit my hubby perfect! He's 6'5, 238lbs, and they fit perfect in length and width. Great for fit and tall men."
1514,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Perfect Workout Shirt It’s lightweight and dries fast; the perfect workout shirt.  Also love that the trim and cut are slimming.
1515,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Five Stars Very nice, like a second skin with comfort"
1516,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfectly fine [[VIDEOID:a1281ded3020a6c1fbdcc8353f7545d6]]
1517,4,B0928FSGGD,1,"Not for me, but might look good on someone else I just didn't like how it sat on me due to the neck line, and it hunched up around the armpits, BUT it's an item of clothing. What looks bad on me might look fantastic on someone else. Otherwise, seemed like a great product."
1518,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfect muscle shirt I've always liked muscle shirts with thin shoulder's and the Y-back design, but could never find one that was not cut too far down on the ribs. This shirt is the exact quality and cut I have been looking for. If any of you are looking for a Y-back shirt that doesn't have the sides cut all the way down to your stomach, then you have buy these."
1519,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great product so soft and comfy
1520,4,B0928FSGGD,1,Nice! Order up in size unless you want a ‘spanx like’ top I’m glad that I read the reviews! I’m normally a size 6 but ordered the Large based on reviews and it fits nicely and still a little snug. I understand that it is meant to be a compression top but I like the feeling of a hug not a squeeze:-).
1521,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Good Very good
1522,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Light weight! I wear these under my scrubs at work, and they are great! I’m 5’0 and I ordered a small, which was a perfect fit! Not too tight, not too loose. Highly recommend!"
1523,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Brighter days Love red and white
1524,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Dress Okay
1525,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,cute but not really like the description Definitely not a maxi dress. It’s a hi-lo. I still really like it. I bought a large and I’m 5’9 and normally wear a 10/12. It’s looser on me and I like that part of it. I did buy another color even though it wasn’t what I expected
1526,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"comfortable even in the heat They are comfortable to wear,  the only drawback there is the underarm is cut a little high.  Otherwise,  they are great.  Can't wear bras after injuring a shoulder,  these do a good job replacing the bras."
1527,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Get’s the job done Fits my fat body good. Only complaint is that the front pockets are a two small for my hands but at least it fits great. Can’t beat the price either.
1528,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Excellent Quality - Reasonable price Was not familiar with the brand.  Took a chance on ordering JOE's and found the quality to be excellent. On par with the best sweatshirts I've owned. Weight of the material is just right too - not too heavy. Would absolutely buy again (and have!).  Price is reasonable considering the quality.
1529,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,LOVE This are so wonderful regularly and going up a size has worked so well as maternity pants. Seriously so smooth and sits well on my growing belly.
1530,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,hubby likes it Nice shirt.  Nothing special
1531,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Good enough for the price [[VIDEOID:d015e6e05098d2f3520ef065a7effe19]] For the price they are fine. Nothing ultra amazing. Feel more like tights but seem squat proof so far. I’m 5’9 and 153lbs and got a large. The waist band is kinda big, a medium would have fit too. If you have a little waist be wary. Good enough. I’ll keep them. I like the color."
1532,5,B0928FSGGD,1,I love these shirts ! I LOVE THESE !!  In fact I loved them so much I ordered 3 more shirts !!  They are snug fitting and keep the heat in !  I have not been warm all winter until I found these shirts !!<br /><br />I am sure if you are getting them for exercise they would be Perfect !!  &#34;Base Layer&#34;
1533,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Worth the $ Had to send back I needed to buy the extra small but otherwise perfect product
1534,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"LOVE Absolutely love these. They’re a little long on me, but I hardly notice it. For reference, i have a curvy build (weigh about 150) and I’m 5’2 and the medium was perfect. Definitely ordering more!"
1535,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,What does it mean? I like clothes baggy however they fit exactly the way they are supposed too. Look up the meaning of the shirt before buying it.
1536,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Comfortable Comfortable and well made. Love
1537,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Received in great condition!!

1542,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Very comfortable Very comfortable tights I can workout in them for hours the only complaint I have is the size - too loose in the waste fits great everywhere else I'm 117 pounds 5' 5"""
1543,5,B09M6X79V9,1,True to size! Very comfortable!
1544,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Great purchase !! Will order again Great fit!!! Love these shirts I am a 32D usually a size small but the medium fits great. Not super tight but fitted. If you want a very snug compression top you should order your usual size... I like the medium though!!
1545,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Great for all day wear. Very comfortable, nice material. The size chart provided was very accurate. If you do not want the fit to be too tight order one size up."
1546,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"It makes me happy! It’s a great dress for summer heat! I’ll also wear it in layers for the winter, too, because I put on my red dress with spots & there is no way I could get depressed."
1547,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,EXCELLENT QUALITY AND FIT. GREAT.
1548,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Wife Loves it! Wife loves them. Cannot beat the price, and they fit correctly."
1549,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great gifts I ordered these as gifts. Pricing is way better then I could pay locally, and everyone is always happy for them. The color fades a tad after so many washes... But that's the way things work."
1550,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fit great! Shipped in a timely Fit great!  Shipped in a timely fashion
1551,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,pretty good tank tops We have ordered and returned a couple tanks before these but these are just as expected.

1553,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Perfect summer dress Fits as described. I usually wear a 16 and got a lg and it fit perfect. So comfortable for the summer.
1554,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Very soft The design was actually better than expect--I ordered the gray camo but there are hints of green in design.  The material is very soft, lightweight and fits as expected."
1555,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"They feel and fit wonderful, and the price is hard to argue with These are now my daily undershirts.  They feel and fit wonderful, and the price is hard to argue with.  Will be buying more for sure.  No need to give your hard earned money away for more recognizable branding, there is nothing inferior about these."
1556,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Sizes run a bit big, so plan accordingly Items arrived in a timely manner and fit well, but are a big larger than most, so order accordingly."
1557,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars Loved this dress. Perfect for Hawaii or anywhere. Comfortable. Great value.

1560,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Fantastic quality The softest most comfortable joggers I own! I do wish they were maybe a bit thicker but that’s just the Midwestern in me!
1561,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect for the price! Washed and it did not shrink in the arms or torso.. true to size
1562,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,qualiy great
1563,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great leggings This is my second pair of leggings from this company. My first pair were larges and these gray ones are mediums. I prefer the mediums due to the compression fit. They are tight. I'm currently in between sizes, medium and large. I can go either way. If you're in between sizes and want something tighter then size down. If you're worried about the tightness then stay with your normal size. I highly recommend this brand and these leggings."
1564,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice value- good quality! This sweatshirt was very nice, medium/heavy weight. I like the side panels. Bought as a gift."
1565,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Five Stars Fits great, lightweight, dries fast."
1566,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Not bad. Thin material is good for hot weather or working out. Wish the armpit was cut lower instead of being snug up in there.
1567,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Wonderful Shirts These shirts are perfect for layering under larger shirts/sweaters.  I ordered them to wear under shirts on a trip during some cooler weather.  They fit snug, which is exactly what I was looking for.  The arm length was perfect for me (I'm short...5', so my arms may be a bit shorter than others).  If you don't want them to fit snug, order one or two sizes larger than your usual size."
1568,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Fitment I ordered them for my  wife.. I like the way they look on her
1569,4,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Four Stars Decent for the price. Sleeve colors aren't as bright as the picture all in all it's nice
1570,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits right! It is hard to find a zip up hoodie that is not slim fit these days. It fits perfect and because so I have bought 3.<br />HIghly recommend and I will continue to buy.

1572,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Perfect Layering Shirt Perfect fit, perfect for layers!!! I  did size up as was recommended. I usually wear a small,  but ordered a Med. Washed perfectly. Would definitely order again."
1573,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Def Recommend Worked perfectly for working out in my cold garage gym. Kept me warm enough but did not overheat me. Perfect for what I wanted! The fit is also very flattering.
1574,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"old-school best Always has been the best, old-school sweatshirt."
1575,5,B09M6X79V9,1,.. I use these tank tops under other tanks and shirts... love them... only wish they came in white as a 3 pack set.
1576,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Amazing Amazing! They are soft and fit great. The highwaist stays secure. I'm 5.5 125lbs and the size small fits great.
1577,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"the Russell Fleece Pullover is a great product at a great price Lightweight, yet quite warm, the Russell Fleece Pullover is a great product at a great price. Fits perfectly and is very visible in the early morning hours when I run."
1578,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Great value and quality novelty dress. Needed a candy dress for my niece's party. The Lollipop dress arrived quicker than expected. Special fabrics often run $15 per yard or more. This is totally worth it. It's well made and all the desings are fun. Definitely recommend it.
1579,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"I don't wear dresses often,but I have worn this for a few different  occasions. Comfort  is my favorite"
1580,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Instantly my Second Fav Workout slim Tank I'm 5'9"" at 161lbs athletic build and wear a 41 jacket qnd 31"" waist. These tanks are awesome. They are a fit between slim and compression. On me you can see (darker tank) it is slim on my frame. I'm comparing it to my Nike tank that is my favorite and silkier in feel than these and also a bit longer. But you can't beat the price, fit, and look of these at all. I was totally and pleasantly surprised. I wear a size medium and got mediums and they fit very well. A must buy if you don't want baggy athletic wear that most vendors well here."
1581,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Gym on !! Fit as expected. Good quality. Colors true.
1582,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Four Stars Great dress
1583,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,So cute I can’t wait to wear this on vacation. It’s flows so nicely. Hits right above my ankle and I’m 5’4
1584,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Throw Out The Cotton! I purchased If I recall 4 packs of these. I threw out all of my cotton tank tops. I live in the South and get gets very humid here. These tank tops are much more breathable. When doing any kind of sports or athletics this is what you want. The moisture wicking is fine for my liking. I have worn these working in construction, playing airsoft, and at work. The material has held up nicely. The sizing is accurate as well. I'm a rather tall individual (6'6) and the XL fit me well.<br /><br />I can't find any negative with these tank tops. I wish four came in a pack. I also wish they had a pack with all gray color. Either way I enjoy these. They really made me relook at all my under layers. to the point I have changed all of my cotton out into more breathable material. Material that does not hold moisture."
1585,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Nice hoodie Another plain run of the mill hoodie but seems to be of a good quality.  We will see how it holds up
1586,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Good fit Oudside wear
1587,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Excellent This is a very well made sweatshirt, it is heavy weight and so far it has not rubbed up like most."
1588,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love them These are the best!  I love them. I get compliments at the gym and when I go out. There's very flattering and fitting..
1589,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great Overall Undershirt! Good Comfortable Compression undershirt. Ordered Large which was a perfect fit for my Athletic built Frame.
1590,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Very light loose fit good for working out if you want something that hugs ... Very light loose fit good for working out if you want something that hugs you a little bit more going size down

1592,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"BUY THEM SIS ! I absolutely LOVE these leggings ! If you’re on the hunt for great leggings, THIS is your sign sis . What are you waiting for ? I love that they’re high wasted and the compression on these psshh  GIRLLLLLL they suck everything in and sinch the waist beautifully. I will definitely be buying more."

1594,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice sweatshirt The quality seems good on this product, and my husband felt the fit was as it should be.  Nice soft material inside and out."
1595,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars LOVE THESE
1596,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Great leggings- just go up a size I got these leggings because I was told they are dupes for more expensive ones. I ordered the recommended size and normal size I order (small) and they were way too small. I then ordered a medium and they fit much better but are still a bit tight. I love these leggings but I definitely recommend sizing up one or two sizes. One thing I wish they had was a side pocket. Overall these are great leggings though that do not fall down throughout the day.
1597,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Surprised😁 I had doubts but was shocked this really works. No roll up and the material is great. Highly recommended

1606,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Retro hoodie Haven't received as many comments on a piece of clothing since high school (over 50 years ago). All were positive.

1619,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Every little girl should have this dress! There hasn't been one time that my grand daughter has worn this dress that we haven't received a compliment in the cute little kitties.  I have now ordered the teddy bear bomber jacket because the quality of this brand is amazing!
1620,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Great summer dress I bought two of these dresses for my daughter and she loves them. She wears them all the time!
1621,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,WOULD BUY AGAIN ANY RUSSELL PRODUCT IS WELL MADE AND THE HEAVIER WEIGHT IS EXCELLENT FOR WARMTH AND FOR SWEATING IT UP!
1622,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Fits great and arrived on time Fits great and arrived on time. Works great for me on runs, at the gym, or when i want to be little warmer"
1623,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Good shirt I bought these for my son who has taken up running. They are lightweight, well made and cool. The shirt doesn't ride up when he's lifting weights or running. He weighs 250lbs and the xlarge was perfect!"
1624,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great product I always Russell Athletics product. They very comfortable to wear.
1625,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars Great quality especially for the price!! Buying more!

1627,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Great Hoodie for the price and good quality I very much like this hoodie. For the price you can't go wrong.  I think I'll order a second one.

1629,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great Shirts! Was hesitant but glad I ordered them.  The fit was perfect and the material is very nice.  Someone complained about the shirts not being dryer machine friendly but honestly it took about 20 minutes to line dry.  I'm 6'1&#34; 190lbs, very fit and the large was perfect!"
1630,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great everything My husband loves them
1631,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great sweatshirts for the price The quality of the material was great and the shirts fit as well

1634,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfect for summer! This dress is so airy and comfortable! Was looking for a loose dress that wasn’t totally boxy and this dress was perfect. It will be a great dress for the hot summer that’s beginning! For reference I’m 5’6”, 230lbs and I’m wearing the xxl."
1635,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Really nice hoodie It's a really good feels a little cheap but for the price it's really good does fine and the color is right
1636,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfortable and durable, good fit. I wanted a thin, form-fitting athletic top to use in lieu of a tankini top. I don't like ruffled opened back tankini tops with patterns, etc. This was perfect snug & form fitting, but not too tight. Sheer but not completely see through, which didn't matter much to me because I just wanted some added modesty over my everyday bra. Very soft and smooth on my very sensitive skin. I find even smooth materials itchy when others don't. I was afraid i had snagged it a couple of times when I had accidentally touched rough or prickly items but when I looked it was fine so it's not too easily snagged either which makes it perfect for family beach trips when its hard to be careful. I'm very happy with this product and the price and would order 6 more if I could, to wear every day!"
1637,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Item fits well and service was fast.
1638,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Nice medium weight hoody. Quickly shipped.

1643,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Someone tight fit Fabric is perfect for workouts. Light weight airy and great colors. These tanks have been my go<br />To for workout tops in the sun.
1644,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great value!!! Great value and satisfied the very picky person it was intended for.
1645,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Soft I bought a 3 pack and one shirt is wayyy shorter than the other two. Since my torso is really short the shirt still fit good I'm just not used to a shirt ending so soon after my pants start 😅 😂.
1646,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Best shirts ever for work I wouldn't say they wun small but they are supposed to be compression, so if you, like me don't like that just size up.<br /><br />These are the best shirts ever for work! My job is very physical and they're breathable, light and they fit almost like a second skin!"
1647,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Perfect I LOVE this. Perfect bubblegum pink color and very soft. I ordered a big size so it could be big and comfy and got exactly what I wanted!!

1658,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Five Stars Beautiful dress!! Lots of compliments. Silky material. A bit longee than i thought it would be. Sizing is correct
1659,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Stretchable and comfortable These leggings are so good! The quality is very good, it is kind of a thick material and to me feels like it would be too hard for it to rip anytime. It fits me just right, above my belly button, and not see through. I ordered a size small and it fits well but I’d like to try a medium next time! Definitely recommend these though! The charcoal color is so pretty.  Great purchase ."
1660,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Sweatshirt Great piece, that fits well and keeps me warm,but is easy to take off and carry."
1661,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Super soft and comfortably over-sized. Used for a jack frost costume and it worked perfectly
1662,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Size down I like the color and material I’m usually a small in most yoga pants and leggings so I ordered a small, but I get some sort of cameltoe I think I ordered a size too big. Next time I’ll order an extra small and see how that fits."
1663,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Quality Just what he wanted.  Russell is the brand for a good medium weight sweatshirt.
1664,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"comfortable, and seem to be pretty moisture wicking Definitely size up for these.  I normally wear a small or medium, and ordered a large.  They fit well, hardly any extra room.  These shirts are well made, comfortable, and seem to be pretty moisture wicking."
1665,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,The best sweatshirt This is one of the most comfortable sweatshirts.  I have been looking for one for a while.  Fits perfectly and the fleece inside is soft on the skin

1675,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,Four Stars Comfy!
1676,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I love this hooded sweat shirt I usually wear a 2x in sweatshirt; this one fits a bit large, but nothing I can't live with.  I love this hooded sweat shirt.  It's warm in winter and shields my face from wind."
1677,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars well made, a little thicker material than others. sewmanship (?) pays attention to detail"
1678,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Fit perfect!! I absolutely love these shirts! I have to wear them under my scrubs to cover my tattoos and they fit perfectly! They’re long and just stretchy enough. I got another 3pk delivered today and will definitely be ordering every color!
1679,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Fits snug, but its supposed to! These shirts are the perfect amount of tight for a undershirt, I'm 6'5 320 and the 3xl is a perfect fit!"

1690,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars Awesome hoodie! Can't beat the price.
1691,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,It feels odd at first but you get used to it These shirt are honestly pretty amazing they allowed move steady and more controllable movement whenever im working out

1697,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Wow for the price It’s great
1698,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Outstanding fit AND look Very pleased with this product.  I'm 5'9&#34; 190 (moving toward 180!) and this fits extremely well--does not fall too long or too short (length) at all.  The feel of this shirt is not ultra soft like some of my Underarmour products but I don't think it was designed to be--just a BIT more cotton-y.  But it's such a good get-down-to-business shirt, and looks great."
1699,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great hoodie for the price Great feel to the material and it is very warm just like it should be not too thin to go for looks.

1703,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect sweatshirts I love the fit of these. They are thick and comfortable and have been holding up nicely through many washes. The grey seems to shrink more than the other colors, not sure why. These were pretty much my uniform for the winter and spring."

1705,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,I love these sweaters been wearing them for a while and ... I love these sweaters been wearing them for a while and really can't say nothing bad about them. I mean nice comfy feel plus it's half cotton and polyester so you will not have any shrinking issues at all. Oh yeah can't beat the price neither!!!
1706,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Worth it 5’9 135lbs, usually size 5-6 in pants. I have an athletic build, the waist of the small fits great but they are a bit tight for sweats. Not what I expected for the type of fit but I still love it. Definitely slightly short too. I’ll probably get more."
1707,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great tank for the price Ordered the wrong size but they fit my son perfectly!
1708,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,This sweatshirt fits exactly how I wanted it to.  Just baggy enough to be so comfy Love the fit and the color

1710,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fits and looks great I bought the hoodie as a gift and it fit them perfectly! Great value and not too pricey! It’s very comfortable and just what I was looking for.
1711,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"I love this tank I love this tank, bought in black and I just ordered another in grey. I'm 5'2&#34; 140lbs and the fit is great. Fits loosly but that's how I expected, perfect for the gym. Will probably buy more colors in the future."

I’m not 1 to usually leave reviews but I figured I could help someone else out. I truly do love these shirts."
1734,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits perfect Fits as expected and can’t beat the price
1735,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Comfy Very comfy and warm 🙂
1736,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Yeah thee ha thr Blah haha 😄
1737,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Perfect Summer Maxi Dress I will definitely buy this dress in the other colors! I love how it fits so loose at the waist that it is flowy, yet it is very light.  The fabric, in my experience, is basically stainproof.  I spilled coffee and I dropped some of my salad with sesame dressing on it and it just wiped off without staining! I got so many compliments while wearing it and it is the perfect summer dress!"
1738,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Great Tops, Order Size Smaller if you Want Compression I am 5'5 and 140 pounds. I bought a size Medium. As for a compression garment I highly recommend ordering a size smaller. But if you don't want it as compression order your normal size. I just ordered my second set because I love these tops so much. I sweat profusely when I exercise and these tops are great at whisking the sweat away."
1739,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Metal zipper feels like older material junk that pills Good quality
1740,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Four Stars Seemed a bit big for an XL, but not so big that it was a problem."
1741,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Thick material. Good quality and nice colors! They fit me well for what I wanted. I bought them to wear under my scrub top. I didn’t want them to be too tight because I get kind of claustrophobic. One problem I did have was that the material is a lot thicker than I expected. I wish it was thinner!
1742,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Five Stars beautiful
1743,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Squat proof! My favorite leggings!
1744,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Fits good Fits just right and great price
1745,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great product! This top is amazing, great for yoga, great fit. Will buy more!"
1746,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars The shirts fit perfect.  Thank you.
1747,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Cute Cute and LOVE the green color- only complaint is that it's really low cut on the sides
1748,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love the dress Love the dress! Very comfortable and loose. I wish it was a little thicker fabric because it is quite see through, but I love it!"
1749,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Five Stars Comfortable and lightweight, just as described. Great for lifting and not getting bound up in loose clothing."
1750,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Great sweatshirt This is the 4th Jerzees sweatshirt I have purchased. They hold up very well.
1751,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"La cálida es muy buena,El acabado de la textura excelente y buen precio precio justo Excelente tejido, entalla muy bien, recomendado 100%🏆🏆🏆"
1752,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Not what I was expecting These tank tops say compression. I thought I would feel more compression while wearing them. I originally ordered a size bigger thinking they would fit. They turned out to be too loose. I ordered the next size down and still feel a little loose. I was really hoping they would feel more compression. I feel if I go down another size, that pressure I am looking for from a compression still won't be there. However, they work well as an under-tank for wearing sweaters. The material is soft and well-made."
1753,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Decent for the price. It's an average grade hoodie, not heavy duty. It's true to size. Color and look matched the picture exactly. Quality is good for being a 20 dollar hoodie and is very cozy. I will probably buy more in the future."
1754,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Nice singlet for the price With the bitter cold weather we've been having, my running and biking have been limited to a treadmill and bike trainer on my sunporch, which is at 55F.  I was looking for a base layer for under a long sleeve T.  I'm 6'1"", 155lbs - the medium fit perfectly, and is very comfortable - no chaffing during a two-hour run."
1755,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Great I ordered a small and it fit great, I’m 5’1, and weight 125lb, nothing to envy to gymshark"
1756,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Not exact but it's cute Colors were a bit darker and the stitching is purple not white but it's cute.
1757,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"I am very happy with my compression t-shirts fit as are described I am very happy with my compression t-shirts fit as are described, material is ok. One more thing sizes does run small. Love them."
1758,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice! Heavy, warm and roomy!"
1759,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great hoddie Great quality, fit as expected..."
1760,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Just what I was looking for. Just what I was looking for.  Four stars the hood is extra large really need a cap when using hood to keep it from coming down over forehead blocking ones eyes.  Other than that a great addition to wardrobe.
1761,5,B076QD9NP1,1,As expected. Happy 8 year old in the size 8-9
1762,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"I'm a ""Full Figured"" guy and it fits very well. Great quality and price -- A+++ Highly recommended.  I'm a &#34;Full Figured&#34; guy and it fits very well.  I love this."
1763,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Five Stars Arrived on time and was exactly what i was looking for will be ording more!!
1764,5,B076QD9NP1,1,"As far as Chinese dresses go, this is made well This dress is so stinkin’ cute.  I worry about ordering dresses from amazon sometimes because a lot of them are Chinese, sometimes cheap material.  This material is soft and stretchy.  It’s just as colorful as it looks in the photo, and is simply designed."
1765,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Best dress ever. Super comfortable and very flattering This is my favorite dress of all time. Love love love!  Super comfy, love the material, and looks great on me, makes me feel skinny! Would recommend it for all body types."
1766,4,B0B16Q1854,1,"Smaller than expected Love these but, I wanted them baggy the xlarge is tighter than I thought they’d be."
1767,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Teal color is lighter than pic Super comfortable! I’ll buy more. They teal color is much lighter than the picture shows! Still cute though! Just not what I expected.
1768,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Four Stars Fit great and very comfortable
1769,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Pleasant Suprice I purchased this hoodie to replace my beloved hoodie I've had for a few years now.<br />I wanted the same gray color to keep the tradition going of having one.<br />This hoodie is light, but yet it keeps you very warm.<br />I purchased it oversized to layer without having to wear a big coat<br />while driving. I will be ordering different colors once they are back in stock<br />Well worth the purchase."
1770,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"if you don’t like seeing definition and the results of your workout To be honest, if you don’t like seeing definition and the results of your workout. Do not buy this product!<br /><br />I feel confident in this style of tank and comfortable doing another set without worrying about looking like a sweaty mess."
1771,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"A great buy!!! These are great sweatshirts! Soft, durable, bright colors! I got two for my kids (10 and 11). They wear them constantly!!"
1772,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Totally worth it ! Love the fit and definitely buying more. 👍
1773,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"he's elderly & gets cold easily! Very nice The thickness is what he needed, he's elderly & gets cold easily! Very nice!!"
1774,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Very nice Quality material
1775,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Extremely comfortable soft as feathers....great fit
1776,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Must have! It's beautiful! A little big but I am definitely going to but another one in a size smaller!
1777,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fits perfectly! Fits wonderfully.
1778,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Forget the big brands and just buy a ton of these! These muscle tanks are great. Buy as many as you can afford. Or as many as you can fit in your gym bag. Or fit in your dresser. These look and feel great if you're running, working out, or just lounging around the house. The cut is loose enough to provide good ventilation, yet trim enough to move with you. The fabric is breathable and feels great against the skin. These are a terrific value compared to what you get from some of the big names in athletic apparel."
1779,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Runs a little small I read the reviews and realized this product runs a little small. I’m 5’3”, 145 lbs and bought a size large (I’m normally a medium) and they fit perfectly. Not too snug, not too big."
1780,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Wash them a few times and you’re golden Flattering comfy pants. Comes out of the bag looking a bit shiny - 2 washes took care if that issue - looks great !
1781,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great, classic sweatshirt! Color and fit were perfect and will order another. Bought this for my husband. It fit him perfectly! He likes the color, fit and fabric feel. It washed well too. Will order another!"
1782,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Does not feel like a compression 🎽 It does not feel like a regular compression airt
1783,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Love the product Love the product. It is somewhat thin compared to other hoodies I own however this hoodie is still good for keeping you warm! Will definitely be buying more in different colors.
1784,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"Perfect Fit The dress fit very comfortably and nice. I love the color as well, perfect fit and match for my skin tone."
1785,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Just buy them These leggings are absolutely perfect. They are not only flattering but also provide the compression I want for my workouts. I’m 5’9/170 lbs and the large fit perfectly. They are squat proof and super comfy. The only small disappointment was the moisture-wicking. It does show sweat slightly. But that doesn’t really bother me. Customer service seems great. They really stand behind their leggings. I will 100% be ordering these in more colors!
1786,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,as advertised! The negative reviews had me doubtful but these fit as expected and are very flattering! They were perfect for my hiit run and they are squat proof! I will be ordering more.
1787,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Pretty great for price Simple yet great looking workout shirt
1788,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Five Stars nice fitting
1789,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"My favorite ever Hands down my favorite leggings.  I have every brand and type. These i went back and bought 4 more colors. Squat proof but the stretchiest, softest leggings I’ve ever found.  You could sleep in these.  And they are really cute. They are surprisingly slimming even in bright colors because of these tone on tone dots that are in just the right places."
1790,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Good for workouts & undershirt I just received them yesterday. I did not expect a criss cross back. The fit is true. I thought they’d be thicker. They’ll serve the purpose. Thank you
1791,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Cute and true to size Perfect to wear as a dupe for leggings to fit in the school dress code
1792,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Perfect fit, looks good I’m 6’4, 240 and bought the XL size. These fit just right"
1793,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Perfect Exactly what I needed
1794,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars products good, but my mistake i ordered too large"
1795,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Love those! Loved them, very slimming and fitting, waiting to see how they hold to wash. If they hold will buy 2 more pairs, best leggings ever."
1796,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Beach Coverup w/ Other Lives! What did I dislike? Any seamstress would have put the seam up the back (& at least came w/in reason to match the print). The fact that the front dip up some is a good fashion statement; but, still no excuse for sloppy pattern design. That being said, in the wide world of movement, flow, & most outfits fitting more like bathing suits, nobody was ever going to notice this. Especially given the fact that it was my last minute decision to wear it to a graduation ceremony in lieu of a beach party. It was a perfect last minute decision. Living in FL. I'll be wearing it to as many parties and trips to the grocery as I will the beach. It is flowy & comfortable. Actually quite well made (bra adjustment straps) aforementiond diss notwithstanding. & we are seriously talking, what, under $20! I want More! Oh, & there were like 3 black polka dot dresses in the crowds and this was, by far, the best fashion statement!"
1797,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,very motivating sporty
1798,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Bought as a gift Bought for my brother who said I should have gone a size larger.
1799,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,comfy and breathable fits just right. size are accurate
1800,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfortable and roomy. I'm not a big guy, by any means, but do work out and this sweatshirt seems to fit pretty big. It's very comfortable and will fit over most anything, so it's r great for just throwing on when you need to run outside real quick. Also, it's very nice to workout in since it has &#34;water wicking&#34; properties. If you're looking for something &#34;trendy&#34; or more fashionable, this is not what you want. With that said, I bought two and love them."
1801,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great fit and quality! This shirt is very comfortable and looks very sexy on my man.  I am going to buy more in the other colors.
1802,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Gift Exactly what was wanted. Good quality too.
1803,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"liked it so much i bought another might be a bit too big, but with the way clothes vary in size it may be that other items I've bought are too small... comfortable and warm.  liked it so much I bought another!"
1804,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,He liked it We liked it
1805,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Very comfortable I love the pants, I want to order another pair"
1806,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Perfect to sweat it out These do the job well for my weight lifting workouts! Open back keep you cool and the overall performance is great
1807,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Glad i found it here can't find it at the stores Love it
1808,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Just what I wanted The pullover is just as advertised. Soft inside and great fit. I ordered an XL for a roomy fit for layering.
1809,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Five Stars sweater is so pretty. very comfy!
1810,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Just Right For them Cool So. Florida Winter Nights Perfect weight, comfort & warmth for them<br />col So. Florida nights at the beach or waterfront.  Washes nice and dries quick.  Durable folds nice and perfectly fits in the bike basket.  I ordered the XXXL, one wash and it fits perfect on my broad shoulders."
1811,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Perfect. Heavy duty and fit just right. Love it! Came in mail fast n fit like it said it would.
1812,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Very cute Nice material
1813,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great hoodie I have bought 2 of these already.<br />I highly recommend. It's not to heavy nor light weight. It's perfect.

1818,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"They really work I like these a lot. They’re tight as I expected. I am 5’10 and roughly 175 pounds fit and I purchased a Large and it fits great. The bottom is long but I guess that for tucking into your pants or shorts.<br />I wear them when I workout, play basketball and when I cycle. I’m looking to purchase more and in different colors."
1819,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love it! Comfortable, stylish, easy to wear. The dress was not expensive but I've gotten several compliments on it."
1820,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Great for running around Great for workout and outdoor
1821,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Met my expectations Product met my expectations
1822,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Very comfortable! I was looking for a ton of compression due to having recent tummy tuck surgery. I would describe these as moderately light compression, but they are very comfortable & I like them."
1823,5,B009R09Z8W,1,It is for cozy boys I liked that It was a sweatshirt. I used it to warm the upper half of my body.
1824,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,"Great value. Would highly recommend Neleus did it again. Great fit,<br />nice material, good selection on colors and a great price. Have not ever been disappointed with Neleus products."
1825,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"One of the best leggings I’ve ever purchased! Great quality, price is on point, true high rise that doesn’t roll when doing squats, no camel toe, not see through.  I’m 5’2”, 125 lb and the XS is perfect with just enough compression!  Length is perfect as well.  Much better quality than most leggings that are three times as expensive!"
1826,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Quality Like the product, but turn colors after a couple of washes"
1827,4,B009R09Z8W,1,Four Stars Joe's worked very well with my exchange.Very cozy compared to my Staff hoodie. Customer service is top notch.
1828,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Exactly as expected The product was a little late, but was exactly as expected when it did arrive, I will be getting more..."
1829,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,only shirts i use to workout Very breathable and has a little stretch to them! love wearing these while at the gym
1830,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Best Ever I LOVE these! They are the most comfortable pair of athletic pants I’ve ever owned. I’m between a small/medium so I bought the medium, and they fit perfectly. I often have trouble finding pants that fit my waist AND my lower body, but these are perfect. They are also soft, the fabric is wonderful. I usually get Victoria’s Secret brand, but this brand is way better. I will be buying more again very soon."
1831,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,"good but not perfect some edges are not well sewn, but overall it's a great top"
1832,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Awesome workout tank! Loved the way they fit!
1833,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Overall the quality seems good for the price. I was hoping for a tighter fit, but the quality seems good."
1834,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,💕 love Fits perfectly
1835,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Good quality. I wear these to work every day in Afghanistan. They have been through the washer numerous times and are holding up very well.  Great product!
1836,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Good jacket.  True to size.  The hood is a little heavy on your back.
1837,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Priced right. Can't beat the price. Good quality. This was my second time ordering.
1838,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,"Better in person Love the color, cut, shape, and construction. versatile to coordinate. Looks great on"
1839,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good Value for the Price Simple straight forward zip up sweatshirt hoodie. Perhaps just a tad bigger than size, or maybe that's just the cut of it. A dry cycle should take care of that. I plan to put some Red Sox patches on it to puunch up the look. Good value for the price."
1840,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Love it! Love it!! I ordered the red, and it's much darker than expected 😟 But it's super comfortable and still flattering!"
1841,4,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Four Stars Great

1845,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Love these! Huge fan of these, would buy again! Sizing was great, although a little loose."
1846,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"THESE RUN SMALL Great material! Very comfortable. But I usually buy a medium shirt. After reading reviews, I ordered an XL. Glad I did! These are still very form-fitting. I will wear these to exercise and under something, but no way alone in front of someone, unless I want to show off my belly fat!"
1847,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Just what I was looking for. Right on!
1848,5,B09M6X79V9,1,You're be happy with your purchased! Just wanted it!
1849,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,great price got this for my son. he loves it. we got this for his cross country team as a warm up.
1850,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Five Stars great price!! fits well
1851,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Extremely Warm I bought this hoodie to stay warm at work. It feels like the air conditioner is on, even in the winter. I'm always cold and tired of wearing my coat inside. I buy Russell's sweatpants and they keep my legs warm so therefore, the fleece hoodie should also keep me warm. The hoodie is comfortable and the fleece is a heavy material not flimsy. Will definitely purchase another in different colors."
1852,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Tank Tops: My Go-To Workout Gea I used to struggle to find comfortable and stylish workout clothes until I discovered Neleus Men's Athletic Compression Tank Tops. One particular incident where I was able to observe the difference the tank top made was during a high-intensity interval training session. Not only did the sweat-wicking fabric keep me comfortable during the entire workout, but the compression also helped with muscle fatigue and reduced my recovery time.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Comfortable fit<br />High-quality material<br />Sweat-wicking fabric<br />Muscle compression for reduced fatigue<br />Quick-drying<br />Durable and long-lasting<br />Cons:<br /><br />Sizes may run small for some individuals<br />Compression may be too tight for some<br />Compared to other products in the market, Neleus Men's Athletic Compression Tank Tops stand out with their affordable price and high-quality material. While competitors like Under Armour and Nike offer similar products for a higher cost, the Neleus Tank Tops provide the same level of comfort and compression without breaking the bank. If you're looking for workout clothes that will last a long time and keep you comfortable during your toughest workouts, give Neleus Men's Athletic Compression Tank Tops a try."
1853,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Great joggers! These were more fitted than I was expecting, but I like them! A looser version of leggings. I’m 5’6 155lbs and got a large!"
1854,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Bought as a gift Bought as a gift, he is wearing them"
1855,4,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Solid! Stats: 160lbs, 5'9'', 42'' chest circ - Got medium size.<br /><br />The fabric feels nice, the chest fits perfectly, and the length is ok. The length fills off but it isn't the length, it is actually the circumference of the waist/bellow chest. It is a little ""square"" rather than ""V shapped,"" which would be preferable. The white one is a little see-through, but not too much (just FYI).<br /><br />I think I could have gotten away with the small, since I am 10lbs over usual weight (always seating in the 145-152lbs lean). I might try their small ones for other models. I got three of this model and three without the hoodie and I don't regret it. Loved it! Great product for the price (paid about $50 for 6 shirts atm)!"
1856,4,B09M6X79V9,1,"Comfy and supportive I love love these tanks, I order a medium and wear them as undershirts as I can hardly stand a bra cutting into my shoulder. My only complaint is every single order I have had at least one of them fall apart around the arm because the seam gave out. Sure would be nice to buy something without having to repair it..."
1857,5,B07S8KMCQW,1,Buy it now! I absolutely love this shirt. So light weight and lays well. Ordering so many more colors.
1858,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Five Stars Really like these pants.  Fit well, and the dark gray color is great."
1859,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Favorite workout top and everyday use also. Stretchy and very flattering
1860,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Super comfortable I absolutely love these dresses with leggings and boots in the winter. So comfortable I wear one everyday.
1861,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Good value and fit Durable, warm and functional. Didn't break the budget like those other Big on-line stores for outdoor wear."
1862,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great product These are so cute and fit perfect.
1863,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Fits good.  Keeps me warm. These fit good and keep me warm.  That’s all I was really looking for.
1864,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Love these I'm ordering some more
1865,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,These are perfect! Buy them!!! Just got these in the mail. Wore them last night for the first time on my way to the ER. They fit perfect and are so comfortable. I am planning on buying 2 more. Buy them. You won’t regret it. I got medium and I’m 5’5 135lbs.
1866,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Men's muscle t shirts Fits perfectly
1867,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,As good as a tank top could be Great for training and running errands after training
1868,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"the most amazing leggings i’m addicted to seamless leggings and i wanted to try some more affordable ones, these are hands down my favorite ones (better than gym shark) and half the price. I will be ordering more!"
1869,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Impressive quality. Really impressed with quality and fit. They are fitted in a good way, I will not be tugging and pulling on waistband. Held up well during workouts and runs.<br /><br />Ordered true to size."
1870,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Awesome tanks I absolutely love these tanks!!!! I originally bought 3 and once trying them I bought a lot more. I need to get some that are bright and fun colors.
1871,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"PERFECT LEGGINGS I LOVE these! They are so flattering, they wash well, they are high waisted. They are comfortable! Squat proof. They may slide down a hair, but it's not crazy. Material is soft and just thick enough to keep everything in. I have thick thighs, I'm 180 @ 5'9"".  My waist is about 33 in. And my hip is 44 in. I bought a size large. They fit perfectly 👌"
1872,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,"I love it!! Super soft, amazing quality for cheap price"
1873,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Five Stars exactly as pictured.
1874,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars great for my man to wear under his jacket for work!
1875,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Definitely will buy more!! Exact dupe for gymshark
1876,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Just received my order an hour ago and I'm wearing ... Just received my order an hour ago and I'm wearing one now. I was worried they wouldn't be long enough (I'm 6 ft) but it goes well below my hips. I have gained weight with age (I'm a senor citizen) so ordered an XL so it's a little loose but still clings to my body shape. If I had ordered the next size down it would be tight enough that I doubt I would need a bra. The material is light, seems to have decent ventilation, not as hot as I expected. The closest thing to a negative I can think to say about them is that the cloth is shiny, not matte as the photos look."
1877,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Awesome product Looks good. Fits grest.
1878,4,B07BM9GWG7,1,"Four Stars A bit shorter than expected, but fits well."
1879,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars Only thing I didn’t like about it was that the stomach part of the sweater kept bulging out
1880,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Fleece hoodie Perfect looking for this color love it
1881,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Neleus I love Neleus products but the sizing can be a little off. In the same package you can have different fits. I size up because of this. Sometimes I wear these as a base layer and sometimes I wear these alone. They are super comfortable and wearable. They are also flattering. I highly recommend.
1882,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Love ittttt , such a steal!!! Omg!!! So when I first opened it I went like WTH? Why is it cropped and tossed it to the side because I didn’t expect that it would look like that, especially since it will get cold soon. I don’t need nothing cropped (I’m 5’9) . So I gave it a try before writing the seller and it fits amazinggggggg. It’s long lol. That’s my second pair from them and I will definitely get the rest of the colors cuz it’s such a steal."
1883,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Smaller than I thought but still fits Comfortable fit.
1884,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Sea foam color! I bought a large because they ran out of smalls and medium but I love love love the cool mint color! It fits like a large and is really pretty!
1885,5,B07XD71F1H,1,"So comfortable and versatile I'm 5'2"" 140 and ordered a medium. Fit perfectly.  This is easy to accessorize and dress up or down."
1886,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Nice Muy comodaa para hwcer deporte
1887,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Great fit Love these shirts for spin!
1888,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Five Stars Great color and great fit.
1889,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Everything is perfect but the waistband. The quality is great but like other reviewers have mentioned if you carry any weight around your lower abdomen these aren’t very flattering, the band is much shorter than other leggings I own and pushes any extra skin above and below the band. I<br /><br />The wait band does not flatter me well. Not sure if sizing up from a medium (what I ordered and normally order for leggings) to a large would fix this issue as they fit nicely everywhere else. I’m also very short and these are oddly sized in some places but I don’t blame that on anything but me being too small.<br /><br />I have no complaints on quality or price but I did wish these fit and flattered me a bit better."
1890,5,B076QD9NP1,1,Adorable and priced appropriately Adorable and exactly like picture and description.
1891,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,sundress My current favorite for hot summer days at home or evenings out with a loose-knit long black cardigan
1892,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Buying every color! I am not one to feel so in love with a product that I write a review but let me tell you I am going to buy as many pairs of these as I can. The material is stretchy and is excellent in quality. I ordered an XS. I struggle with the way leggings cut ... down there ... but the way these are made (like gymshark leggings) that’s no problem!! Buy them!! Totally worth it. Plus they make your butt look delicious.
1893,4,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Four Stars Use it for laying, don't have much compression function though."
1894,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,It fits Super comfy 💕
1895,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Feels nice. Nice and flowy. Has pockets. Very comfortable. Good material.
1896,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Very comfortable wear Comfortable
1897,4,B07XD71F1H,1,"What I was looking for! This dress suited my needs well - I'm tall and it was long enough to wear with just tights. Material was thick enough to not be see-through. It is a clingy material, but the dress is plenty loose/flowy. I actually belted it around the waist to give a little more shape"
1898,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Let’s go A bit see through on back side
1899,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars good quality
1900,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Order a size up Remember to order a size up
1901,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Perfect for nursing. I wear these under my scrubs. Size up one size.
1902,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"So soft and comfortable I love these joggers! So happy I ordered them! I’m not one to leave a review but the reviews definitely helped me to decide to get these. I definitely agree to size up. Typically I would have order a medium but sized up because of other reviews and went for the large, and They fit loosely with out being bagging. Definitely think the medium would have been more tight like yoga pants."
1903,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Son de buen material Son de buen material y bastante frescas
1904,5,B07XD71F1H,1,Love this dress! Okay I love this dress you can wear it with boots or flats & it looks so cute also with leggings or without! I really love the feeling as well super soft! I think I’m going to buy ever color! I love dresses with leggings in the winter with my boots!!
1905,4,B009R09Z8W,1,"Soft, Fits Good I got a size larger than I am, an XL, and it fits perfect. I got the blue, red, and grey all<br />perfect, but the grey fits kinda weird and feels different from the others. Love the hoodies tho! Would recommend."
1906,4,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Pretty good Really really nice pair of leggings, buttt the prints look nothing like the pictures"
1907,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Love Comfy n cute!

1911,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Best of the best! These are the best leggings I’ve gotten off Amazon so far. So comfortable!! Can’t wait to buy more!!
1912,4,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Ok jogger Just not for me-I’m a short, athletic build and these were just not flattering. I love the fabric, love the pattern, love the pockets, but the fit is for a different shaped body than mine. I’m 5ft 3, 140lbs and ordered a medium. They fit perfect"
1913,5,B0928FSGGD,1,"Made very well! I ordered a Large  (I'm 5'1 / 160lbs) and they fit great! Stretchy, fitted but not too tight. Colors are awesome (looks just like photos.) They are made well and I will be ordering more!"
1914,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,Love!! I love these leggings! They are super flattering and fit as expected! I was debating between a medium or large pair but went with the medium. I am 5’6 and 158lbs with a booty for reference. They are super stretchy and do NOT fall down! They are also squat proof!! I have worn them to lift but not for cardio yet.
1915,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Great plain black sweatshirt Great plain black sweatshirt. Medium thickness- which is great for cold nights. It is more of a regular fit, so not very form fitting - just cozy sweatshirt."
1916,5,B097RFTKJP,1,Love the material Anytime I can throw a dress in a suitcase w/o worrying about it wrinkling I’m sold. Nice light summer dress. My husband loved it.

1921,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,I like it. The dress fits tight up top but ... I like it.  The dress fits tight up top but the rest is just fine.  I plan on wear it to my sons graduation with leggings under and a light jacket or shawl.
1922,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Great fit Love these! Not tight like leggings but similar feel.
1923,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Not a bad Buy I would buy again It runs a little bit bigger then expected

1925,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Great progress I have now been using these T-shirts for the last five months and love them. Having never had a compression shirt before I did is fabulous. If you're looking for compression shirts these are the ones you should purchase!
1926,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Comfy, but runs fairly big. I received this today, and the medium fits more like a large(maybe more). However, the heather black is nice and it seems comfortable and well-made,  so I'm going to try ordering a small."
1927,4,B07CQ84KLT,1,Four Stars Hangs and flows nicely. Great for travel.
1928,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,Soft fabric This is well worth the money. I liked the softness of the fabric and I always love hidden side pockets.
1929,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Good fit, order a size down for ""compression"" fit As others said, runs a little large, so order down.  Fits great,  good colors,  good quality"

1931,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Absolutely love these! They are perfect fit and the accent ... Absolutely love these! They are perfect fit and the accent colors looks great and fun. They dont run small but do fit like compression shirts so they at supposed to be tighter on you.
1932,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,Loved them Comfortable
1933,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Five Stars Love love love......exactly what I needed for Tennis and to wear under my scrubs at work.
1934,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Na Great
1935,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"XL- loose fit, L-tighter fit! 🏋 Outstanding product! The fabric is thin but does it keep the heat in, good for cold weather, just make sure you stay hydrated in warmer weather... My fit is loose, as I am concerned about washing it and shrinking... If you want a tighter fit, order a large size, instead of XL.... 5' 10"", 216#... 🏋"
1936,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,"Great shirts but they messed up on the order Great quality shirts but I ordered the red, grey, black to get the red. Instead I got the navy, grey, black which I already have. Not returning as I like these shirts but will try again at another time for the red"
1937,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,As described. My husband loved it!  We had been looking for an all black hoodie for a while.  Shopping on Amazon is so convenient!
1938,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Fits wonderfully I love this item.
1939,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Looks good, feels good Looks and feels really good. A little on the baggy side, but not too much.<br />Even wear it around the office sometimes."
1940,5,B0BVMLJTFS,1,"Size M purchased I am 5'4"", 135 lb, I purchased the size M, and it is so comfortable and fits perfectly."
1941,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"excellent feel, warm and soft but not too heavy. These wash and dry great. Size is what I expected."
1942,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Five Stars Great feel and fit
1943,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Great Sweatshirt --- Great Price I bought two of these in black and navy for my husband to wear over a shirt for warmth and I got him XXL and they fit great and are roomy and allowed for a little shrinkage maybe so that after you wash and dry them they still fit good.  I like Russell brand anyway so these worked out really well for him.
1944,5,B09MJ6NSNM,1,Lo importante es que me quedo bien la talla Por la tela me gusto y el color
1945,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"love the comfort for just hanging around Have the dress in other colors, love the comfort for just hanging around."
1946,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Decent light-weight hoodie. Decent light-weight hoodie. Better quality and a lot warmer than something from WalMart, but not as heavy duty as a Carhartt or any other heavy duty work wear company. The price could have been just a little lower."
1947,5,B08F1V3KB9,1,"Perfect Love these! Brought them on a snowboarding trip to wear in the cabin. So comfy and the waistband is seamless on the front and just a little elastic on the back, to keep them from sliding down. Very flattering. I got the black in a Large. I am 170 and I probably could have sized down but I wanted to be safe. I have bad luck with online pants fitting. Size down for a more fitted look or stay true to size and be comfy as heck!"
1948,5,B01JUP0DLQ,1,Love it! Item exactly as expected. Good quality!
1949,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,Four Stars It snug and cozy.
1950,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Nice thickness, fits and washed well Fits as expected. Washed well."
1951,5,B07CQ84KLT,1,"Lovely material, soft and flowing I’m 5’5” and 149 lbs. I usually wear a Medium or a 10. I bought this in a Medium and it fits beautifully. The color is a vibrant cool red (as opposed to a warm red) with white polka dots. The material is soft and flowing, not see through. It comes to just above the floor in bare feet but right about my ankles with 3” heels. The straps are adjustable and it has pockets on both sides. I liked it both loose and flowing or with a belt. This dress can be dressed up with heels and a belt or casual with flats. It would also be fun over a bathing suit. I would definitely purchase this style again."
1952,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Love pink Not to tight
1953,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,Oferta engañosa No era lo que esperaba

1960,5,B009R09Z8W,1,Perfect. Will order more I love this products! I'm usually a 2-3XL so I ordered a 5XL so I could have a nice oversized hoodie and it's so comfortable and the perfect thickness
1961,4,B09KHSM7BB,1,"The Classic Heavyweight Hoody These units are exactly the way I like them.  Heavyweight cotton poly blend.  No zippers, no flair, no nonsense.<br />I would have given this fat bastard a 5 star rating, but the neck is slightly constrictive."
1962,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Awesome These sweat pants are obviously designed by a heart specialist. Because when your wife puts these on your heart will race to levels never seen before.  If you live your heart is good. If you die then someone else gets to enjoy your wife in those sweats.
1963,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Good Good
1964,5,B0B16Q1854,1,Don't buy They run small I wear a 2x and they are so small
1965,4,B09H6MXJ71,1,Only minor gripes. Thicker back width than the pics and I'm a very wide backed person it fits perfect just wish the outter threads were softer around the chest and arms holes. And the back was a lil thinner

1967,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Love it. Very comfortable. Not the same as one that I've had for several years. The cuffs are falling off that one. 17 yrs later
1968,5,B0B2KL8C8Q,1,"Love these shirts-super comfortable I purchased these shirts as a base layer for hiking, snowshoeing, etc. I did size up from my normal size because of other reviews saying they are form fitting. I’m glad I did!  They are just the perfect fit in the bigger size and very flattering. I wear these anytime I’m active inside or out. They work great as a base layer but also just on their own. I’m very happy with my purchase."
1969,5,B0928FSGGD,1,Great Value! Great value!
1970,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,Comfy n affordable One of the best cheaper hoodies I’ve bought. So worth the $15! Deft buying a few more. Super comfy super affordable! I also bought a Hanes brand hoodie and this color is much deeper. I’ll be sending the Hanes bk!

1990,5,B09M6X79V9,1,"Corren muy grande si deseas te ajuste, debes tomar una talla menos El material es lycra excelente calidad"
1991,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Love! Love this sweatshirt!!!
1992,5,B09M6X79V9,1,Great Fit and Length Perfect for wearing underneath another shirt in the cooler months and will be perfect alone for summer.  I like that they are a little longer and they do not ride up!  Love them!
1993,4,B07S8KMCQW,1,"Great for working out! Love this tank for working out, arm holes are really large and neck is a bit high but it is comfortable and breathable."
1994,5,B09H6MXJ71,1,Very good Very good
1995,4,B09M6X79V9,1,Great besides the white one The black and gray ones are amaxing. The white one is see through and one must wear another tank top under it which makes it harder to keep cool during workouts.
1996,5,B084LJ5ZJ5,1,Wife loves it My wife loves it and wears it all the time
1997,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"These run large.  Happy with my purchase. I normally wear an XL.  A small seems to be a hair too tight and an XL just a little large.  So, I normally go with XL (better too loose than too tight). So, keeping that in mind, I ordered three of these shirts in and XL.  They were way too big for me.  I returned them and ordered the Large.  The large is good and I will keep them.  Even the large is somewhat larger than the normal large I purchase.  In my opinion, these are somewhat large for their size.  And this comes from a lot of experience with clothes.  As far as product quality, these are nice shirts, comfortable and will be what I need for working outside on cooler days.  Have to remember, in most cases you get what you pay for, but my opinion is these are a good deal for the low price."
1998,5,B07BM9GWG7,1,Fits to perfection I love the product
1999,5,B09KHSM7BB,1,"Perfect! Good fit with a medium weight fabric, which is what I wanted. Well made and very comfortable."
2000,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Bad The sleeves are too large
2001,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Sizing is definitely 2 sizes to small Went off the size chart and still did not fit properly
2002,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Zipper poorly made. Zipper broke the first day my husband wore it. What a wast of money.
2003,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"They looked and felt nice but I could tell that they were too big ... They looked and felt nice but I could tell that they were too big for me, so I didn't try them on.I'm returning g them today"
2004,1,B0B16Q1854,0,You get what you pay for and To small
2005,1,B009R09Z8W,0,One Star It was way to small and to short
2006,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,A bit disappointed The material is kind of scratchy and the arm length was very short
2007,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Three Stars Great beach wear, but shorter than expected. The length is about mid-calf."
2008,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Just ok. Nothing special and doesn’t fit great but the price is really good.
2009,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Just a lycra layer NOT COMPRESSION
2010,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"DON'T BUY! the shirts i got were almost see-through, super cheap fabric, and were not to size"
2011,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"These tanks are not long I like the product however they ""ride up"".  I was looking for something that stays put and doesn't crawl up your body.  I do like the fabric."
2012,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Runs small Size up.
2013,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"More shabby than sheek. The material is light which is perfect for a workout shirt. The stitching somehow bunches the material at the seems just enough to be distracting. Good for lounging around the house on a hot day. Not terrible for the price, but I won't buy again."
2014,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"looks like it is made for Too large, looks like it is made for gigants"
2015,2,B0B16Q1854,0,A low waist low hip level It is very low waisted
2016,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Runs Big! I consistently buy t-shirts and tanks LARGE size.  They will fit me just right to just a bit loose.  These are huge compared to most larges I've purchased in the past.  3 stars because I like the material and design.  Be forewarned about sizing though.  (I'm 5'8"", 175 lbs.)"
2017,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Wouldnt recommend Sizing was horrible
2018,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,These are not compression shirts These are not compression tank tops
2019,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not Compression Tops Very loose fitting, thin material.  Could be used as a sleep top."
2020,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,It's ok Little too light / see through and not as soft as I had hoped but it is acceptable for workout clothing.
2021,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Nice material, not so nice fit I'm 6'1&#34;, 145 lbs. These have a weird fit to them. They sort of have a bell shape to them, almost like a dress. I definitely need something more form-fitting with some stretch to it. The material was nice and breathable, but was a little too baggy and short for my build."
2022,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Poor Quality I did not like anything about this product. The XL was to small the XXL was to large, Poor quality, The hoodie is difficult to adjust where it extends on your shoulders. donated all items to goodwill"
2023,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,HOPE YOU  LIKE TO WEAR  HEAVY PLASTIC! Material is very stiff and uncomfiortable -another waste of money!
2024,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Rent for sleep shirt or working out or to wear under a hoodie I am 5'11 and weighing 300 lb. Size extra large was too tight and small. I can wear a size extra large tank top regular cotton fruit loom. These are not cotton they are a workout polyester material moisture wicking. It's it's a little silky and feels cool. The cut of the tank top is nice full exposure of shoulders and shoulder blades.
2025,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Material is little too thin for me. Material was too thin. Wanted a little more support.
2026,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Ill-fitting Purchased in a large. Almost fits like an XXL. I do like the material.
2027,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too itchy I didn’t care for these tops because they were hot!  The outside is soft but the inside was too scratchy
2028,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Disappointed Disappointed, after the first used the thread begin to come out… because of the price I paid, I was expecting something better."
2029,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Color This product was really really vibrant, where as in the picture it was a bit more pale, still a comfy hoodie, just wouldn’t recommend if you want a pastel hoodie. (:"
2030,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Agrietados y con bolitas del roce Están comodos pero a los 10 min de ponérmelos ya se hicieron bolitas del roce y en la primera lavada se agrietaron las letras y el caballo , la verdad que la calidad no es muy buena eso si son calentitos por lo menos para estar por casa ."
2031,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Sizing not as accurate They feel great but it was suggested I get a xxl due to measurements and height and found it fit like a regular t shirt with zero compression so I will attempt to order a size smaller
2032,1,B0928FSGGD,0,"DoN I bought these for running and they constantly ride up. I must tuck it in for it to stay in place and that’s pretty uncomfortable while running.  They are itchy and I wouldn’t recommend them,"
2033,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Never again. Just did not fit right for some reason.  I usually buy Fruit of the Loom.  They just seemed kind of ""baggy"" on me.  I'm 5-10 and weigh about 146 and the medium just didn't look good on me.  Give it shot if you want."
2034,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,not the best quality shirt/material. This shirt looked nice the first time I wore it. After one wash and air drying it (I never put my workout shirts in the drier) this shirt got little fuzzes everywhere! Super annoying. Now it has turned into a sleep shirt ahhaha 🤦🏻‍♀️oh well.
2035,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression It's not that they are not good thank tops, it's that the description says ""compression"" and that's lie. I purchased the extra small, which is insane because I'm not an extra small at all, I'm like a small bordering a medium. I wanted them to fit snug though because I do a lot of intense training with inversions so I wanted to keep things from getting dishevelled. It's ok for that since I bought xs, but not even close to what I hoped for. Other than that they are very good quality normal thank tops"
2036,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Don’t be fooled There were only two in the package...
2037,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,SEE THROUGH MESH TANK TOP. NOT FOR ME. I'm SOOOOOO disappointed in these!!!!! They are mesh and WAY too see through!!!!! Will be returning.
2038,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Runs small Runs very small
2039,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Wrong size Size chart was wrong had to order a second order to get the right size.
2040,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheap quality On the first wash the lining around the arms came undone.  I was able to wear it once on vacation and one of the three was done.  The other 2 are hanging in there with small parts of the threading unraveling.
2041,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Cute But Flimsy I bought 2 pairs of these sweatpants, one fit great and was even a little big, this rainbow lettering one runs extremely small and short, almost like child sizes. Super disappointed that the same brand can run so ridiculously different all around just by purchasing a different color, waste of time."
2042,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Not the right color I had requested the color Natural, but I received Sand. I am going to keep it, but I am not happy. I paid over $32. 00. I should have received what I requested. Very disappointed"
2043,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars The body of the sweatshirt was fine but the sleeves where huge comparably.
2044,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Material not great For the price not so great the material is horrible see-through and I have tried to buy several dresses from different companies on Amazon and sadly Ross, target, Walmart, Costco has better quality and is way cheaper"
2045,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Order a size up, maybe... Too small! They are tight and also do not fit my long (and chubby) torso."
2046,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Runs small, and short, but comfortable? This fits okay... it looked so long in the picture but it seems like for larger sizes they just made it wider (it's too short).. it's super comfortable but I'm glad I read the comments and decided to order 2 sizes larger then I normally wear. I wish people could make nice things for larger galls."
2047,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Awful shirts Dont waste your money! They are way to short & ride up.
2048,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Material not as expected I should have done more research.  Not a bad product and I’ll wear it some but I didn’t realize the material is equivalent to an old 90’s basket ball practice Jersey.  Not the fit or feel I was expecting.
2049,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"I ordered per their sizing chart I ordered per their sizing chart but XL was too big for me (5’6”, 140 lbs., 34H) I had to return and ordered next size smaller, large (when measured. My. Bust is 43 inches) per large size max bust is 40.6 inches & hips are btw 44.1-44.9 (my hips are 41 inches) the large fit ok, but had to shorten the straps a lot and the stupid draw string tie looks weird.  Will not cover any bra easily, recommend it only as a beach cover up"
2050,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Color posted is not color received The hoodie itself is fine. Unfortunate, the pink color posted is not the pink I received."
2051,2,B07XD71F1H,0,not true to size Order one size larger as they are not true to size
2052,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Arms run very small in the plus size I ordered a larger size to compensate for my larger arms it's still a little tight but I'll be able to wear with a tank underneath and get the look that I want
2053,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star The fit is nothing like the pictures. Very disappointed. You can get better cheaper ones at Walmart.
2054,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Plus size ladies....not for us! I am 5'4"", 225 llbs and purchased an XL because that's the largest size they have. Material on the legs is super stretchy...really liked it, but the waistband is awful. It's much tighter than the rest of the leggings, emphasizes my lower belly area terribly, rolls down and just has way too much compression. It's disproportionate from the rest of the leggings.<br /><br />If you have a relatively flat stomach or just a slight pooch, these would be great, but if you carry weight in your mid section, avoid them."
2055,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"You get what you pay for. I wasn’t particularly impressed with these tanks. They don’t offer any compression at all. In fact, the material seems a little cheap and thin. But, you get what you pay for. I’ll still try to use them as an under layer for certain tops. I should have ordered a size up too, because they are a bit smaller than I’d like."
2056,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Great for working out Didn't catch the "" compression "" description.  Wasn't looking for a workout  shirt. I wanted cotton."
2057,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not moisture wicking Not great. I would not buy again. I sweat through them.
2058,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Horrible The color was not the blue I chose, it came in as a purple color. There was too much fabric in the crotch and two tight everywhere else. Also the material felt like leggings and not the soft jogger material."
2059,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"One Star I should have sent these back. Don't buy for compression because there is none and there too short,"
2060,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Very unhappy with this purchase. This product came to my home in a shrink wrap bag. The wrinkles were so bad I could not possibly give this as a gift. Sadly I ordered three of them. And the sizes run so small none of them fit.
2061,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Two Stars Coarse and stuff material, not as pictured"
2062,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Eh. Not worth the money. It doesn't look like the picture. The arms are large in circumstance and the back of the sweater from shoulder blade to blade is odd fitting. I'd send it back, but I'm lazy."
2063,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Do not order Did not like this dress.  Fabric was too flimsy and thin.  Sent it back for refund
2064,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"To tight!! Very small, great looking shirts!"
2065,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Poorly made The color strip started to come off after two wash
2066,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Runs smaller then normal is sizes It says it was a large us and xl in Id didn’t realize two different sizes and it’s like a medium us be sure to look at the sizes before you order
2067,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Wanted to love it Ordered XL based on other reviews. Too tight in chest. Wear 44DDD
2068,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,I'm 5'6 and weigh 153lbs. I read a review ... I'm 5'6 and weigh 153lbs. I read a review that if you are about my size a large would fit just right but I would have preferred an x-L instead.
2069,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Kinda Long Fits snug but really long
2070,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"but this is thin like all the others I've found Was looking for a thick sweatshirt, but this is thin like all the others I've found. They just don't make them like they used to."
2071,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ok sizing way off way too small I got XXL and m 5'7 135 soooooo sizing is way off. The shirts will work perfect for a workout. I'm not one to wear facny workout clothes but clothes that serve a function. This shirt doesn't absorb sweat dries quick. Nice
2072,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Pretty huge.... I ordered a XL. I am a curvey female and was looking for a hoodie to workout in. This thing is ginormous though! I’m thinking about keeping it just to have a ginormous hoodie laying around. May come in handy one cold lazy day.
2073,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,The material pilled up heavily after one wash. After only one wash this sweatshirt pilled up heavily.  I bought it for outdoor construction so I don't really care (I just needed the safety orange color) but if your expecting a good quality shirt for 14$ this isn't it!!
2074,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Not what I expected I expected this to be a sweater but it was more like t-shirt material. Not at all what I expected.
2075,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Junk pants and cannot return Disliked everything about them and now it looks like I’m not able to return them, so disappointing"
2076,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Short Too short
2077,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars Toooo big
2078,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"weird ""bathing suit"" material These are a weird bathing suit material that is stretchy but the weight of it is not what I was expecting.  I have never purchased an article of clothing that was made of this material before.  I probably never will again on purpose. The pattern/design is nice and the fit is fine. It's just that I was looking for something more breathable and loose-fitting than leggings/yoga pants to wear around the house and possibly sleep in that wasn't as heavy as sweatpants. These are neither warm nor cool due to the weird weight and drape of the fabric. Due to the entire garment being elastic-y, they tend to ride up.  At least they have pockets so I can put my hands in there and pull them down.  I just ordered some other lounge and pajama pants and looked more closely at the fabric and materials description after this experience.  I definitely won't be sleeping in these. Will wear around the house this summer and see how they do in the heat."
2079,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Not what I thought they would be. The colors faded,dyes ran all over in the wash. They are in the give away bin. Not warm."
2080,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Just say no Hood ripped off after I pulled it over my head on day one mind you I order a 4x and I wear an xl so it would be big at the gym so I threw it away. Wouldn’t buy again waste of money
2081,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"not a compression shirt I bought it as a compression shirt for my shoulder and the fit is loose in the shld area, but other than that its great."
2082,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Apparently they run small I am 6'0&#34; and 215 lbs.  I ordered an XL.  It was way, way too small.<br />The fabric is nice, however, and the fleece(?) inside is very soft.<br />So... very good quality; order it a size up."
2083,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Thin and see through So thin, completely see through!!  Must pay return shipping."
2084,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Item is inexpensive and good material, but mine had a constant protrusion in ... Item is inexpensive and good material, but mine had a constant protrusion in the stomach area and zipper always exposed."
2085,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Its Okay. I'd rather that it didn't have the Lettering on the shirt.
2086,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Perfect for the money` This dress is super cute and comfy but it did show wear after just one time use. So if you looking for something long term, this dress isnt for you!! Other then that, its good for the money."
2087,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Color does not match photos The color was not was it showed in the photos in amazon. It’s a much lighter color and not what it looks like at all.
2088,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Way to wide below the chest. If you are thin or athletic build avoid. From, the chest up its great. After that it looks like a maternity dress. Unless you are really jacked or have a huge gut I'd get something else."
2089,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,No tiene presión No tiene comprensión
2090,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Somewhat disappointed in this purchase The tail on the jacket is shorter than indicated in the picture.  It only covers slightly below the hip area.  Somewhat  disappointed in this purchase.
2091,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Joggers thinking they are leggings.... It’s like leggings meet joggers. Very odd mixture. Legging material, but baggy in the thighs... just not flattering AT ALL."
2092,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Squeezes the life out of me Runs small. I wanted to like these leggings but the fit is incredibly uncomfortable. I’m 5’9 and 130 lbs (a slim build) and normally wear a small. I can’t breathe in these. It’s a shame.
2093,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Weird fit Dislike. Weird fit
2094,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Really bad! I ordered the smallest size! They are supposed to be tight. Each color is a different feel to it which sucks. It’s misleading if you just try one thinking wow these are great. You can’t return it after you sweat all over it. So now I’m stuck with paying for 1 shirt i like and 2 that are too big. Really bad
2095,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Order a larger size Order a larger size
2096,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Nice material It is very comfortable fabric, stretchy but too form fitting.  If you have a great body that's fine, but it shows every bulge and can be unflattering."
2097,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,AWESOME MATERIAL MADE  WELL RUNS VERY SMALL
2098,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Great leggings! Just not the perfect fit These leggings are cute, I really think I’m just not built for them. I’m 5’7” and the legs on these leggings were perfect!! They were snug but not too snug and long enough they hit right above the ankle but the waste was just way too awkward on my body. The “compression” band actually hit right and my ribs above my belly button, if the compression band was wider they would be perfect! I’m more of a straight shape less of an hourglass and these were definitely made for more of an hourglass shaped body if you don’t want them cutting into your stomach!"
2099,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Weird fit The draping was awful.  I returned it.
2100,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Luiz No me gustan las lineas k tiene se ven muy mal y acomodan mal
2101,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Really shoddy, doesn't look like a new product I received this pair of sweatpants today. Firstly, for anyone who cares about this sort of thing, it's not Polo Ralph Lauren - they state it explicitly on the tag. (Although it's worth noting that they neglected to mention that on the actual Amazon listing for the product.)<br /><br />Secondly, they're extremely shoddily made. Very thin material. They look like they're pilling everywhere, although it's difficult to tell if they are in fact pilling due to the ""pattern"" of the material. They're also very scratchy.<br /><br />Thirdly, when I tried them on I didn't get the impression that they're actually new, which is a very unpleasant sensation.<br /><br />Do *not* purchase if you're looking for warm, cozy sweatpants. These are not them."
2102,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Too short they are constantly slipping up, they are too short"
2103,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs VERY small... order 1-2 sizes up The tank tops are fine and seem like decent quality but they run so small. I wish I would’ve ordered XL when I’m typically a L. They will prob end up collecting dust in my wardrobe
2104,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Poor quality After the first wash the dye came out of the fabric leaving it looking 5 years old. Terrible quality. Sending back.
2105,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Cheap lookinh Cheap
2106,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Bad buy It is not a garment that I would recommend because it did not meet the expectations that I expected of it. Almost not tight and is somewhat loose. I think it was a bad buy
2107,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Runs large I weigh 185  ,reordered medium ."
2108,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Quality sucks The quality of these tanks sucks so I’ll definitely won’t be wearing them.
2109,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Got these for after breast removal surgery and one was mis-sewed and too large The would have worked if we’re smaller. I ordered extra small.<br />Terrible sad job on one.
2110,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Love the sleeve colors and length The length is much shorter than the picture. Love the sleeve colors and length.
2111,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Ok Just get a small size that what I wear
2112,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,This dress is cute but the seams completely came apart ... This dress is cute but the seams completely came apart. I've had to sew the back and side seams multiple times after only one wash. Today was the second time I wore it and the fabric shredded away from the binding on the right arm hole.
2113,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"Jxstar dress with dessert print Bought this for a neighbor as a birthday gift; it seems to run small/short, but will look cute with some leggings under it."
2114,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Sizing is wrong.....again. Second one that I bought and neither has fit.
2115,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,no no
2116,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,A little too big I just would have went a size smaller if I knew that’s how they fit
2117,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Que es demasiado caro La calidad es media
2118,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Is a little baggier than I expected. Might try to order a size smaller next time
2119,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Poor quality Poor quality bad fit
2120,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"2 sizes too small and swimsuit material Worst purchase ever. Way too small.ordered xl and got what looks like a medium. Material is slick and thin and feels like swimsuit material (shiny, too). Seam is coming apart in crotch area - right out of the package. I don't know how these pants have high reviews. Utter garbage."
2121,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Doesn't fit good. Made for thin people.
2122,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Nah.. Very cute and pretty dress, but after the 1st wash I found a hole.... I wish for the price I paid it was better quality."
2123,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Always order a size larger They are great for the price
2124,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars To large on arms
2125,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars I'm 5'8&#34; and this dress was above my ankles
2126,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Color I ordered what I thought was black and they are more of a navy blue than black, which is frustrating because I wanted them to be black not blue.  🙄"
2127,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Thin & a little tight I’ve been in a medium for 3 or so months but I wanted to be certain they’d fit so I bought them in a large and they fit but I have a big butt so they’re very tight around my butt & hips and pretty loose around the rest of me. Happy I didnt get a medium
2128,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars the arms seem very large and long
2129,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,The color looks very different than in description The color looks very different than in description
2130,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Shrinkage Shrunk up vertically and looks horrible
2131,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"It was ok, but not exactly what I thought based on pix. The dress was longer, below the knee, not above (I ordered XL).  The strap was weird in that it tied on one of the shoulders, didn't like that either.  The fabric was also kind of strange, not what I expected.  I sent it back."
2132,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Junk These shirts are light weight, NO SUPPORT, they are junk"
2133,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Three Stars Good product but if you don't want to feel like a stuffed sausage, get a few sizes up"
2134,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Smaller than expected Runs very very small
2135,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,OK Sweatshirt Bulky cut - not for the athletic build guy.
2136,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Good quality garment. Good quality construction.I like the length.Not enough compression in this size.Should have ordered large.
2137,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not true to size These do not fit true to size. Too small.
2138,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,too small just too small despite same brand and size for their runner y back shirts which are dope so i bought a second three back. holla
2139,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Slippery textured shirts I ordered these men shirts for me, definitely shld HV ordered smaller size, shirts were too large for me. Also, didn't like silky polyester texture.  Was hoping for cotton. I shld HV read description thoroughly so overall probably my mistake but they were inexpensive so no biggie. Gonna wash and put in dryer to shrink"
2140,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not a true size Can’t give it a review product was sent back cause not a true size.
2141,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"but looks great with a thin belt Not exactly was I was expecting, but looks great with a thin belt!"
2142,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Fits well, material weird I was looking for workout tank tops and these were highly rated and advertised. The fit was good, I got my normal size and had no complaints in the fit. I personally didn't like the material which was mesh, almost like those practice soccer jerseys. I was expecting a cotton blend or some polyester, but I guess I should have read all the details. I also really don't like the y-back because it is itchy for me, but that's just personal and probably not a problem for the average guy. All in all, if you don't mind the y-back and you want a very breathable mesh material, then you will love these tanks. They are just not my preference, but nothing wrong with the product. The product is good and as advertised."
2143,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Beautiful dress, poor material The dress is beautiful, flattering, and so comfortable. The fabric is so soft and so breathable. Right off the bat, I thought the fabric was a little thin, and you could definitely see the line of my bra, but I just made sure to wear a dark red bra to match. You can't even sneeze on this material without it discoloring. Literally a raindrop hit it and it changed colors. I also didn't think much of it, I figured when it dried it would look normal, not the case."
2144,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"TOO LARGE TOO LARGE, CAN'T WEAR IT"
2145,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! The Russell brand has always stood for quality, but the sweatshirt began pilling after 2 washings (in cold water).<br />If I could return this item would, but the allotted time has passed."
2146,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Looks great in the picture and super cute Looks great in the picture and super cute, however, when it arrived it was super cheap looking.  I returned for a refund!"
2147,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Terrible material. I worse this dress for one day and was so itchy from the fabric.  It looked and felt cheap.  I gave it away.
2148,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too small I normally wear a large. It said to order up. I ordered a 2XL and it was still tight. REALLY?
2149,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,wrong size Mislabled.  3 sizes to big.  Sent back.  I don't think i would order from Russell again.  Sending order back too much hassle
2150,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Nothing special but good for the price Well. I thought that the pattern on them was more like a textural/mesh like thing, it’s just black dots but that’s okay. The fabric is thicker than expected, but they are still very breathable and stretchy. The waist band is compressive but doesn’t hide everything. They rest of it is not compressive at all. Fabric is thick enough to hide cellulite. They are squat proof. Has had a few loose threads on it but no holes! The stitching seems pretty durable. I’m 5’2 and they hit just about my ankle a tiny bit too long but not noticeable. Don’t really do the butt much justice. Haven’t experienced any cameltoe, but they do create that weird v-shape around ur pelvis. Also the fabric isn’t as soft but I’m hoping they will soften after a wash or 2. I’ll probably get more because for the price they’re pretty good. Overall, they are not as great as I expected but still definitely what I paid for and pretty decent leggings. Just wish they sucked in a bit more."
2151,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Inconsistent sizing The black and blue shirts fit great, but the grey is smaller than the other two. How one shirt in a three-pack can be a different size is beyond me, but I am not thrilled about it."
2152,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Shoulder straps should be a little wider, material is great Great material, but the shoulder straps are too narrow to wear in the gyms"
2153,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Do not like the fabric I love polka dots and the color red, so I saw this I ordered immediately, but, sadly, and I ordered a L, I hate the fabric and even though it’s adjustable, it’s too tight for my chest."
2154,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Poor Quality I sized up two sizes after reading the reviews and it is still tight. The sleeves are a decent quality knit, but the body of the cardigan is a very thin jersey type material that is see through and very low quality. I was so excited to get this sweater and was horribly disappointed when I received it. It will be returned"
2155,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Lounging These leggings are really comfortable, but they don’t really add support anywhere except the upper waist, which just accentuates the lower belly.  The support seems to be in the wrong place, and if you’re insecure about belly fat these might not be your favorite workout pants."
2156,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not thick I purchased this as a gift. Since I have several pairs of Russell dri-power sweatpants, I expected the same thickness and warmth, unfortunately it was not equal.  Again, I purchased this based on my experience with the same brand sweatpants, I was disappointed!"
2157,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Incomplete order Not bad, i thought the midsection would be tighter"
2158,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"too short, in my opinion. im 5'8 and ... too short, in my opinion. im 5'8 and it didnt go to my ankles. it stopped at a awkward length."

2160,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Three Stars Looks longer in the picture
2161,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"NO COMPRESSION, but could be a decent undershirt So disappointed, no compression qualities whatsoever. And on top of that, they run huge. I would typically wear a medium, and I think the only way this would work add a compression shirt is if I had an extra small, but the stitching doesn't suggest it would allow for any stretching. Going down in size to create compression would likely create tight rings around your body."
2162,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Unhappy with purchase The shirts I recieved in the mail are in no way what I expected and they don't look like the picture AT ALL. ALSO they sent me large but I ordered medium, could've small with these but my belly would hang out and I'd look like trailer trash. It won't matter anyways because these shirts are unflattering even if they were the right size.  DO NOT ORDER OF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR UNDERSHIRTS. they do not make good undershirts either."
2163,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Really poor quality They came with a hole in the crotch, poorly sewn, and one of the metal rings where the draw string goes in fell of right out of the package. That said, they are warm and well fitting, snugs up to your bum nicely. I just wish there was some quality control before shipping."
2164,1,B09M6X79V9,0,These tank tops are absolutely horrible. They have ZERO compression These tank tops are absolutely horrible. They have ZERO compression. I am a 34D chest and bought the small - still WAY too big. They are super thin and just downright junk. Returned immediately.
2165,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Two small and I order 2xhhg The tanks said XXL but they r small like size large! Not happy
2166,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression These are not compression. They are kind of fitted but really stretchy and thin. If you have lumps.and bumps you are trying to conceal, this is not the shirt for you. I wish the material was a little more structured."
2167,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Nope Nice dress but not for the price. Cheap material
2168,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Poor quality Fit good at first. Washed them twice, and they are very loose now."
2169,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Color way off.... The &#34;red&#34; one I received was more of an ugly rusty orangey red and the white polka dots were much larger making it more of a white polka dot dress with a colored background, instead of the other way.  I returned mine as the color wasn't flattering on my coloring at all.  And red is MY color...disappointed because the fabric was nice and the cut was super comfortable."
2170,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Its ok Its ok for exercise but size is too small

2183,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Too tight & sleeves too short These shirts were too small and the sleeves were too short for me. Had to return them. Colors and quality looked fine but just didn’t fit as I’d hoped.
2184,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Cheap Washed these one time and they started to rip along the seam.  Very cheaply made
2185,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Runs small Love the v-neck but they run 1 size small (they are compression so I expected a tighter feel but they were  much tighter then expected)
2186,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"comfortable but hard to clean I like the color, good for enlightenment, but the piling is too much and it's plenty hard to get clean, esp. the cuffs.So I wouldn't buy another one."

2190,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Red Color Bleeds... Tried it on immediately upon arrival to see how it fit, both the color and fit were great. However, when I first hand washed and hung the dress to air dry (to have available to wear) the red color bled all over the white polka dots. Never got a chance to wear it outside of trying it on. Sent it back... Ordered in multiple colors, the other colors did not bleed and fit great as well."

2193,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Decent Overall I'm 5'10"" and around 240 lbs. I'd describe my physique as muscular dad bod. I love the way XL fits and the design allows excellent range of motion with no fabric tension or bundled sleeves like a T-Shirt does on me. I have two small-ish complaints. Firstly, after a couple months of wearing each color once a week, the fabric is starting to look picked at and older. Although, it's not so bad that I'll quit wearing them. Secondly, the bright blue color is quite dull in comparison to the ad. I point this out specifically because I was really looking forward to the vibrant blue. All other colors have been on point. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product."
2194,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"not very good quality. The cut of the tank is disappointing. It’s constantly falling forward and I have to pull the backside. It’s very thin, not very good quality."
2195,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small! Runs very small. I am 115lbs and 5’4 and ordered a small. These were extremely tight and unflattering. The material was good quality but going to have to size up 2 sizes than normal!

Not good for yoga because the size I ordered that would fit tightly according to the size chart (L) is loose on the bottom and so flips during head/hand stands.

2211,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Fits poorly. Not in size But in proportion Sleeves were extremely long and it didn’t come down in the front around the neck far enough. I kept having to pull at it but it kept going back.

2217,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not worth the money Fraying and holes upon arrival. Dress is a very thin sheer material  and not like the photo.  I'm afraid if I wash it will dissolve in the machine.
2218,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Beware! The tank tops have a very unflattering stitch that runs across the top and bottom of the tank top. The stitch makes the shirts fit weird and out of shape. It will give your body an awkward appearance. The shirts are also a lot cheaper and subpar material than I thought.
2219,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not at all as expected I ordered a large and it was super tight on the chest so I traded it for an xlarge and it's too big everywhere. Also the polka dots are FAR bigger then they seem in the description photos.

2233,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"buy one size smaller than what you usually wear and they will fit perfectly. The quality is good and I like the little color strips on a black tank. Black is the best for workouts since light colors become see through because of sweat. I hate when that happens so I prefer black. But at the same time I do not want all the tanks to be in 1 color coz that just feels like you are wearing the same thing again and again(specially to people who see you often at the gym). I know thats a weird thing to bother about, but for  some reasons, that is why I bought these tanks in the first place since they are all black with colored lining.<br /><br />Another thing I like about them is they are very soft and made of sports fabrics like that of nike or any other popular brand. so the look and feel they bring is very classy.<br /><br />I just wish I had them in the right size since they were pretty expensive. I am gonna return them though and buy 1 size smaller ones<br /><br />I bought a medium size, and it still is large for my shoulder and arm area.<br /><br />If you wanna buy them I would suggest buy one size smaller than what you actually wear."

2240,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,nice quality I got a medium and probably should have gone for a small.  This is so huge on me I almost swear I got an extra large.  I typically wear small/medium and wanted a little extra room but this is much bigger.  Other than that the quality is very good and I would buy a smaller size next time.
2241,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Run extremely small I recommend that you get two to three sizes larger than what you normally wear. The page suggests that you get one size bigger, I usually wear a small & I ordered a medium.<br />I am 5'8 and 135 lb and my measurements are 34 "" 27 "" 41 "". I probably should have ordered an extra large.<br />I bought these to wear under my shirt at my landscaping job and they are constantly crawling up my hips."

2255,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Item to big Russell products are to large unless you are over 6 something tall. It does not specify that items are for tall people. I was very disappointed when I tried on for the first time. Review your product and mention the length, inseam so people will know if they fit."
2256,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Fits too small Ordered a 2XL and it was more like a L.  Fitting but if you don't want to show all your curves order 2 sizes bigger.
2257,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Bad QC The threading was coming apart already out of the box. My right pocket threading has already come off after only 3 months. The waist part is too tight. When ever I raise my hands it’s lifts up my shirt along with it. The amount of material around the arms is way too much. Very noticeable when pulling your sleeves up. I would not recommend this item
2258,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Very cheap looking.  Horrible quality.  The pattern was mismatched Worst buy ever.  The front of the dress was mismatched pattern.

I tried contacting the company since this was encouraged in the packaging, but unfortunately the first thing they asked me was if I rubbed the joggers against something in order for them to look that way. I don’t think I would be reaching out to them if it was something of my doing. But also, you would think that even if they were rubbed against something, this much wear and tear wouldn’t occur after not even one day. They haven’t even been washed yet but they still had wear and tear. Makes me think maybe they arrived that way and I didn’t notice. I guess you get what you pay for."

I almost returned this dress because the strap part where it tied was not in the front as pictured, so the dress was not fitting right, plus the waist was tighter and more clingy in the waist than I like.  I went back to the picture and figured out I needed to move the strap from the shoulder to the eye hole in front, so the top part fits great now, very adjustable.

I think I'd have to be at least 6'2&#34; for this to fit properly. Unfortunately, I've shopped and shopped in many stores, and every full-zip hoodie I've tried on has been too long, too, so I decided to keep this.

2307,3,B009R09Z8W,0,This is an okay sweatshirt This is an okay sweatshirt. It is kind of stiff when you get it. I have tried washing it to help make it less stiff and it seemed to help a little bit. The bottom of the sweatshirt is a little tight at the waste. It looks good but isn't the most comfortable sweatshirt. I would not describe it as soft and cozy.
2308,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Definitely not name brand quality Sometimes I buy a store brand item and am pleasantly surprised that it’s every bit as good as a comparable name brand item. Such is not the case here. The shirt doesn’t stay put (it climbs) and doesn’t seem to wick very well. The seams irritate me after running several miles and having them rub against my skin. Wouldn’t recommend and wouldn’t buy again. Going to be looking for a better option.
2309,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,it did not fit rite the size
2310,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Ill fitting I usually wear medium. But bought a large in gray and in black. Black is so small I cannot wear them. Gray can be worn, but very skinny legs/hips and large waist."
2311,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Ride up in the front! Holy camel toe!!  I bought these expecting a gym shark dupe and was disappointed!  They did not come up as high as I would have liked and they rode up in the front.
2312,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Needs a little more support Not as much support as I expected, material is very flexible."
2313,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not compressive These are basically workout tanks that are sized one size smaller. No compression at all, no extra elastic, no back support, just smaller shirts… disappointed. Feel good quality material though, the reason for the 3 stars."
2314,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Material is great, Expected tighter Fit The material is great! The pockets are a great size. I ordered an XS because I typically wear a 0-2 however it was a bit too big. There was a lot of extra space. I expected them to be tighter."
2315,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Very Disapponted Not true to size, not flowy like described, and cheap see through material. Very disappointed."
2316,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Not that great. It's ok. The quality is a bit on the thin side, not exactly my preference. I ordered a large because I did not want it fitted however it's still form fitting and not as loose as I would have liked. I'm 5'2"" and 133lbs."
2317,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,not that good Moisture wicking is what your looking for don't buy this
2318,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Disappointed This isn’t a sweater cardigan at all. Not knit. Just cheap printed fabric. Not like pictured at all.
2319,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Don’t recommend. Save your money, they fit weird. The material is shiny stretchy so it is not very flattering.  I regret not returning. I tried to make best of it but live and learn."
2320,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,I was looking for a smaller sweatshirt as I am ... I was looking for a smaller sweatshirt as I am 5'3 100lbs but the arms were way too wide and it was way too short on my waist. Will be returning.
2321,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Two Stars Nice material, but not long enough. I am 5'9&#34; and they are too short. Had to return."
2322,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Me llegaron mal los colores  
2323,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Pretty to look at pretty to touch....FIT, not so much! The product runs small and really isn’t a deal. Just kinda cheap feeling and sleeves are short. Sorry. Colors are pretty but doesn’t fit. Sometimes deals just aren’t deals."
2324,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Comfy
2325,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"sad I was so happy when this dress arrived it looked just like the picture and the material was light and fresh as I had hoped.  The adjustable straps really got me as i'm short and have a hard time finding long dresses i wont step on.  I loved this dress until I slipped it on and noticed a big gaping whole down the center seem right in between my chest.  looks like a bad sewing job.  I was considering sewing the dress, but the whole has started to fray....so disappointed."
2326,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,To dang small These shirts run way to small in their sizes. I wear an xl I’m these shirts it would take a 3xl to fit right. Not happy with this purchase at all.
2327,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Terrible, but its cheap so what do you expect Cheap material. Does not look good. I have a 42 inch chest and a 29.5 inch waist so my build is very athletic. Normally clothes fit my chest and not my waist and that is fair enough. This just straight up doesnt fit lol."
2328,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Completely see through I don’t know if it is just the color I got, but they are completely see through when I bend over. They are super cute, and really comfortable tho!"
2329,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Fits small + Color not as in Photo This cardigan runs quite small. The chart says that a XL is the equivalent of a US XL but I think is more like a M or L. The color that I received is definitely not the same as the one pictured. I'm not saying is ugly but it's not what I saw and liked. The fabric feels real soft and is thin like a T-shirt. Idk why, but I expected something a bit thicker. The quality is good."
2330,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"All different in look. For these in and they aren’t what was described at all to me. Definitely no compression. It is super light weight and comfy to wear. I got 3 pack of the grey, white and black. All 3 are different. The white is shorter and material isn’t as soft. The black is a little tighter and longer. And the grey was lose and the same length as the black. None were as long as what I wanted or thought. But The fact that all 3 were different from one another was disappointing. Only thing these have going for them is the material is soft and would pry be good to work out in."
2331,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Happy Sailed Women Halter Neck Boho Print... the small was very big under the arms
2332,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"The color is more of a softer pink Picture shows a hot pink or ""highlighter"" pink but it's actually a softer pink. Not pastel but definitely not hot pink."
2333,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Stained upon arrival Product arrived stained.
2334,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Very BIG I know the description says loose fit, but whoa!  It is huge.  I ordered a large and it is enormous.  I have a 17.5&#34; neck and the neck line hung down to my chest.  Made my neck look pencil thin.  This is a big disappointment.  I have a couple old Russell sweatshirts I was hoping to replace.  Good thing for free returns."
2335,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression As a person who has POTS theey didn't offer any compression. I returned them.
2336,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"2/3 were spandex, grey one was smaller and not form fitting at all. The white and black tanks were form fitting and the appropriate size, but the grey one was substantially smaller and not form fitting at all. I ordered size large and being 6'3&#34; the white and black ones were perfect length."
2337,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Compression tank I thought it would be a tighter fit seeing as it was a compression top.
2338,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Regular!😊 Esta bien bonito... Soy large con los vestidos y este me quedó suelto nada que ver como la foto así ajustadito en la cintura y eso... Pero la tela es muy buena y el estilo y color bonito... Ya saben pedirlo un tamaño menos.
2339,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not soft at all Very rough feel. I know it was inexpensive and wasn't expecting something out of this world but it feels cheap and not soft at all as one would expect for something described as fleece. For the price there are many other options I suggest trying one of those instead.
2340,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not the tank top for me Fit was way smaller than expected and they definitely were compression tanks unlike what other reviewers had received. I’m 5’ 10, and they were very short on me. Unfortunately had to return"
2341,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star It's not good. Don't buy it.
2342,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Nope!! Were not as long as described and poor quality! If I could I would get a refund. Wash as instructed and shrunk even more. 😟
2343,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Too Loose I am 5'5"" and 135lbs, size D bra. Ordered the medium but it's so large on me. I could fit two people inside of it. I would order down a size. Wearing it with a belt does help. Also it's a bit too polka dotty for me. Wish they were smaller dots or not as white."
2344,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Not true to size I bought a purple one in 2x and it fit me perfectly. I bought this black one after in the same size and it can’t fit me. What is this!?
2345,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Easy to return Did not as desired
2346,3,B09M6X79V9,0,No sé No quedan como las fajas normales
2347,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Compression very loose This item did not compress as expected. Very loose and stretchy.
2348,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cheesy Eh. Fine but not as shaping as I had hoped. Also, they are one of those tanks that you have to keep pulling down. They are not very long either."
2349,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression Material was very thin and not compressing at all
2350,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Worst product I have ever bought This is the worst product I have ever bought after seeing great reviews on amazon. Its too large, almost made to fit a bear not a human being. Never buying this brand again. Buyer Beware"
2351,2,B09M6X79V9,0,The fit Did not fit right
2352,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Fit Didnt  fit right
2353,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not Compression Tops Very loose fitting, thin material.  Could be used as a sleep top."
2354,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Way too big
2355,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Fit is awkward The fit on this dress was awkward.  Although it was a nice pattern and comfortable fabric the top of the dress was cut in such a way that would make me feel self conscious all day.  I will wear it around the house, but not outside."
2356,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Nice as just a normal tank Just wasnt as flattering as I expected
2357,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Poor Quality! I thought since these were US Polo that they’d be decent quality... NOPE! I literally wore them once. The fabric felt cheap, then one of the eyelets for the waistband string fell off, the stuff inside then began to come out of that hole. The string ends are that cheap plastic and was already starting to get soft and appear to be breaking. And the lo and behold, there was already a hole on the pant leg seam. I sent back for a refund because I didn’t trust that getting a replacement would be beneficial given the poor quality of these joggers. I am beyond disappointed, especially since they’re not technically “cheap” in cost: save your money and find another jogger instead."
2358,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Looked it otherwise Alittle too short in length wish it was a bit longer for my heights I already opened it or else I would have returned it
2359,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Too baggy.  Won't buy again. The shoulders of this sweatshirt fit fine, but the waist is much too large and long (well below the waist).  I am of average build, and this sweatshirt is just too baggy."
2360,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Too short Very short - not for those with long upper bodies
2361,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Poor quality. Seams don't match up.
2362,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not good These are terrible I wore 1 time and the Seam ripped
2363,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Not really compression I really wanted this a compression shirt for it's theraputic value but this is really nothing more than a long sleeved excercise shirt.
2364,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Soft and comfy- HUGE I'm 5'4"" 95 lbs. Finally thought I had joggers for a small person. They are huge everywhere but doable with fleece leggings underneath to run outside."
2365,2,B09M6X79V9,0,dont fit too small
2366,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheap material. Not compressed at all! Will not buy again.  Don’t waste your money!
2367,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Too tight I’m 5’10”, athletic build, 180 lbs, 44” inch chest.  I ordered a large and the tank top is tight in the chest."
2368,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Looks ugly in person
2369,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Not exactly the best quality! Received these in 2 days. I wanted to like them but the first one I pulled out of the packaged was frayed in multiple spots. See attached photos. Based on my initial experience I don’t have high hopes for these lasting any length of time. I’ll check the other 2 and hopefully they are better. I really want to like these because they look and feel great. The quality greatly concerns me.
2370,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Tight fit and NO POCKETS I ordered these specifically for the pockets…  but there are none.. I ordered in my usual size and it’s more snug than I would like. Also the material is thinner than usual sweats I buy. I would not recommend buying these sweats…  but if you do I recommend a size up and if you want these sweats for pockets,  forget it."
2371,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Big They come big so order in a size smaller they drink as well and it really wasn't worth the price
2372,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Sewed in the front I really loved this dress BUT the one I got is sewed in the front so it looks really weird, this is not as it is pictured on other customer reviews so I guess I just had bad luck... I will not return as I noticed this after washing it and I have found returns to be complicated but I am really disappointed :("

These are nice but I wanted a material that acted more like a compression shirt not an &#34;dry fit&#34; undershirt."
2375,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not a good fit Tried the shirt on when I got it....the description said to order a size smaller if you want a tighter fit. I ordered a size smaller which is medium, it is still very loose and not a compression tank at all..very disappointed and feel I wasted my money."
2376,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star Junkie junkie junkie junkie junkie
2377,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars My coat still fits over
2378,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Color is off. Not actually red. More of a magenta pink Fits small. I read reviews and sized up. Normally wear a medium and large fit good. Only problem is color. It is actually a magenta pink not a darker cranberry red like I thought
2379,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Mediocre top It’s an ok top. I ordered a medium and it’s still way too big, but if you’re looking for an overly large top then this would be perfect. Not particularly my favorite."
2380,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,don't purchase - even ordering up 2 sizes does not ... don't purchase - even ordering up 2 sizes does not help - states cotton blend but this is really cheap nylon fabric and although I am 5ft 2&#34; tall and ordered an XL this is not as long as pictured and does not hang well. save your money
2381,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Best alternative to the magic GAP sweatshirts of the mid-90s GAP used to make the perfect sweatshirt in the 90's of this style - the inside wasn't 'fluffy soft' like this, but thinner - not exactly fleece.<br /><br />This is traditional fleece, which just doesn't hang as well or look as good, a bit staticy when removed, but its the closest I can find to the magically GAP sweatshirts of the 90's."
2382,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,short in front no spandex this looked nothing like amazon photo.. it was shorter in front and didn’t have stretch
2383,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not squat proof at all Not squat proof
2384,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Wrong color I ordered the WINE red however received the bright red… it’s just annoying to not get what you paid for.  I do like the cut.  I did order the larger size for some room and it is light and easy - 2 great summer qualities.  I would order another color but  hesitating since I didn’t get what I ordered the first tile around.
2385,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Wrong color I ordered a pink but got orange, was disappointed but not returning it incase someone else will want it."
2386,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Color is off. Not actually red. More of a magenta pink Fits small. I read reviews and sized up. Normally wear a medium and large fit good. Only problem is color. It is actually a magenta pink not a darker cranberry red like I thought
2387,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Eh. The fabric is too slick so it slips off everywhere.. Theybare wayyyyyy too short.
2388,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Two Stars Very small and short.
2389,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Good, but could be better Good for the money (2/3 so far), however after one wash one of the sleeve seams came off. The other two held up fine so I’m hoping I only got one bad shirt. Otherwise, I’d buy them again as long as they hold up. The comfort is nice for a workout shirt, and the shape makes the muscles look good 💪🏼"
2390,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Runs Large If you are looking for a snug fit, I suggest going down a size. I ordered according to the size chart. My tops fit like blouses. I had to give them to someone.<br />The colors are beautiful, however."
2391,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"China measurements different than U.S. This item has a short hemline in front which I missed in the description,  as I am over 50 and not into trendy styles.  Overall, I like the simplicity of the dress. I wear a Med but ordered large to be sure it was long enough.  This dress still lays above ankle."
2392,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"theyre short i usually use tanktops as undershirts and i cant with these, also the material feels weird"
2393,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Cheap and not like pictured Side cut outs are huge , shows much more of sports bra than what picture does, so now it’s just a sleep shirt."
2394,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Just a tank top not a compression top at all The material is to thin to compress anything but other than that they aren’t that bad.
2395,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"I previously ordered a sweatshirt and was very happy with the fit and style I previously ordered a sweatshirt and was very happy with the fit and style, so happy in fact that I reordered that exact same sweatshirt in a different color. The new sweatshirt was much larger, with a different fit and feel. The neck opening was large enough to fit around my waist. Very disappointed!"

2399,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"no pockets description said these had pockets. if they didn't, I wouldn't have ordered them. I only found out after I had washed them & put them on that they did not have pockets. seriously disappointed."
2400,2,B07XD71F1H,0,"Not much structure It's a fine dress, just know that there's not any structure, so if you need that, don't buy it.  It's just like drapey cloth"
2401,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Very  poor quality This first time I put it on the seam came completely unraveled. These aren’t the quality I was looking for in a tank and I would not recommend them.
2402,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Returning item defected One of pockets were sewed shut
2403,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star bad quality i'm returning it ...
2404,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not true compression shirt These are some nice shirts. They are not true compression shirts. They fit like a regular shirt from Walmart. I was expecting a T-shirt that was going to really flatten my Stomach.
2405,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,See through You can see straight through them if you do any bending / squatting.
2406,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,not comfortable.. washed and dried before trying on...not comfortable...should have tried it on first
2407,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Disappointed The top and bottom part are sewn together!! I would send it back but she needs it for Friday at school! Afraid to separate it because I don’t want there to be a hole! Very disappointed! You can totally see it scrunched up when she has it on!
2408,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"He could easily have worn the small just fine but This fits as expected although, from other reviews, I thought it would run much bigger than intended - it doesn't. My son is 5'9&#34;, 150 lbs., slender (runners build), broad shoulders. It fits roomy but, not overly baggy.  The arms are generously wide/big.  He could easily have worn the small just fine but, as I said, it's roomy and he likes sweatshirts that way."
2409,3,B009R09Z8W,0,dont buy the material is very poor and uncomfertable i dont recomened it
2410,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Material is pricky These shirts are OK.  Fit for a large is a little too snug.  The material (polyester) these are made of is not a comfortable material as many of my other polyester workout shirts.
2411,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"tooooo high waisted These were SOOOOO high waisted. I have a shorter torso, but they went up to my boobs. Ridiculous 😩"
2412,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,uncomfortable seams Bought this to ease neuropathy pain for family member.  The seams are rough and hit right at the most tender spot. Otherwise the quality was acceptable.
2413,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Horrible it's super short in the back Horrible it's super short in the back, does not look anything like the picture . I don't want to give it any star but requires you to rate it"

2415,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not Lifting I am 5’6”, 143 pounds, wear a medium so ordered a medium, the belly is covered, however, it rolls, and does not stay firm and tight. And clearly not butt lifting. I have a bit of a booty, and these made me look a bit flat in the booty area. Not satisfied nor happy with these at all."
2416,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not satisfied 😕 Not tight enough.
2417,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Disappointed Looks much nicer in the picture . Poor quality , shorter than expected and much smaller than expected."
2418,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Runs too small
2419,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Too small. These particular sweats fit like an extra small. I ordered a medium.  The fit is different from previous orders.
2420,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Comfortable Not much spandex to this compression too
2421,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Do not fill an order with incorrect size.  If you don't have the item, let customer know. I ordered a medium size but got the large.  It is huge. The quality is outstanding and I am so sorry it does not fit.  Time is precious these days. Please try to fill the order as requested or not at all.  I gave you three stars for the quality of the garment, minus 2 stars because my grandson needed it for school and missed out."
2422,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,that it's going to fit. I like the colors.  I can never get the right size. Every brand seems to be different in my size. One of my shirts came inside wrapped in a plastic bag. The other two were not. It made me wonder if they returns.
2423,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Run small This run small I bought large and it was tight on me so I give to to my daughter
2424,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"use as an underlayer Thinner fabric than I expected.  Can't be worn alone, but fine as an underlayer."
2425,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Nah I look like Barbie meets MC Hammer.

I just read another review that said they thought the dress might be backwards. Based on all the reviews I went with a XL, I could not even get my top half in. It did fit better worn backwards but, come on."
2429,2,B09M6X79V9,0,I wanted to love these I wanted to love these! They fit well. The fabric is thin but it’s good for working out. The problem is the red dye had ran onto the yellow shirt. I was very disappointed so I had to return them!
2430,1,B076QD9NP1,0,Not satisfied Product ate way to small
2431,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Very disappointed with the overall quality of the product Poorly made:  I ran it through one wash and the seams got all winkled up and mis-aligned.  Very disappointed with the overall quality of the product!!!
2432,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not what we expected. My husband did not like the fit or the material. He says it is just another tee shirt.
2433,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Fits great Love them
2434,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Not satisfied The  the cut and fit on this is very odd and does not fit as shown in picture.
2435,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Hugs tummy but beautiful, size up Love the pattern and fabric, very flattering. I’m 5’5” 161 pnds, ordered large, it hugged my tummy which is not big but not toned either,  returned for XL hoping is not so huggy."
2436,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Short The back is short
2437,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Decent They feel good. I bought the xl navy. They run a bit smaller than expected and the crotch seems split the first day! They weren't too tight, just more snug than I had wanted, I bought a bigger size for the extra room."
2438,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Inconsistent fit I bought a pair of these last year and they fit perfectly. So I bought another pair and the new ones didn’t fit at all. Very tight in the crotch area. Returned them immediately.
2439,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Comfortable but not sweat proof Loved the fit of the leggings. Felt very comfortable and it was really nice to not have the front seem. Only issue was by the end of a sweaty workout I looked like I had peed on myself. The material did not wick away sweat and with it being a plain textured it did nothing to disguise it. I’m someone who is comfortable with myself and don’t really care but I feel like prints could be helpful for those who would be embarrassed by that.
2440,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Lovely dress with an unacceptable flaw Great fit, attractive print, BUT the fabric pills. I should have returned this but I needed it for an event. Not sure if all the dresses have the same fabric. This review is for the LEOPARD BLACK."
2441,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Too small. Size chart is wrong. If you think large will work, do yourself a favor and go up a size. These things are small."
2442,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Just OK The material is rough and scratchy not soft at all I really did not like these tank tops. Although they fit fine. True to size.

2444,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Worst product ever. Tears with one use.
2445,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"but also like a stretchy silk pillow instead of an athletic tank This should not be sold as a &#34;compression&#34; tank. There is absolutely no compression in this fabric at all. It is also on the short side, as it doesn't hit my hips. The fabric is soft and stretchy, but also like a stretchy silk pillow instead of an athletic tank. I've gotten better quality tanks from Target or the department stores."
2446,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Short I ordered an extra large they sent me a medium, so I couldn’t even put them on. But they’re very thick like you can’t see through them, great for working out breathable, the seams are very nice everything looks like it was a great quality, just said that they sent me the wrong size.But they’re very thick like you can’t see through them, great for working out breathable, the seams are very nice everything looks like it was great quality, just saw that they sent me the wrong size"
2447,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"good You can also.Sleeves a little long, but the impact is not too great. Clothes, work is good.thank you very much."
2448,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"I felt like I was a kid wearing my dads clothes This sweatshirt is way too big on me, I felt like I was a kid wearing my dads clothes, I normal wear large in all my shirts/hoodies but their large is more of an xxL. I HIGHLY advise to buy at least one size below what you wear"
2449,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Nope It was huge pilkadots when I thought I was buying a cute simple print front was low and uneven<br />Would not recommend
2450,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,I'm totally disappointed It's made very awkwardly... I'm totally disappointed
2451,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"it looks like a small or extra small WAY TOO SMALL!  I'm 5'9, 165 lbs, and wear size large. A large was sent to me and I could not even get both my arms inside the dress to slip over my head!! Looking at the circumference of the inside of the dress, it looks like a small or extra small. Length is good. Plan to give to my 5'11 size 5 daughter, but I almost doubt it may fit her?!"
2452,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Don't buy it. The inner fleece material shed after 2 washes.  Who knows how much fleece would be left after successive washes so I returned this item.
2453,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"This does not run as small as reviewed I am not a fan. It is a bit short, and the cuffs are really small. I expected a better quality garment."
2454,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,A Russell Mini-dress I am a girl - I ordered an XLarge.  I have an old Russell - just about falling apart - loved it.  Wore it for years.  It was an XL but not extra tall.  The new one came with a tag saying XL-XT.  I am so mad - now I have to return it and get another one.  Maybe Large or Medium.  I don't want one that goes down to my thigh and sleeve that is too long.  Why Amazon does talk about that in their description of Russell Sweatshirts is beyond me!  Not nice - not fair - not true!!!
2455,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Poor quality Awkwardly shaped and very see through. More of a bathing suit cover-up than a dress.
2456,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,not good for me this cut is for slim fit
2457,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Shiny material not sporty or flattering It was true to fit but a bit shorter than the picture and the material was shiny😩.  Cotton more comfortable in this heat.
2458,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Three Stars Nice material, but they are a little shorter than I expected."
2459,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Expected sue to purchasing online The dress was a little snug, but I turned it into a Halloween costume anyway!"
2460,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Cheap Discolored and a hole in them after the 1st wash
2461,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Not worth the money Pants came with a giant hole in the pocket, and after 2 washes the eyelets have come out. You get what you pay for, I guess."
2462,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"EXPECTED MORE COMPRESSION NICE AS A REGULAR T, BUT NOT AS A COMPRESSION SHIRT."

2466,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too pricey for what you actually get Thin cheap material. Not compression at all. Feels like  cheap halloween costume material.
2467,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Suck Dislike
2468,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Way too large Size much larger than expected and returned
2469,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Crappy product Pilling terribly.  I can’t wear in public— the pilling is awful. Never again. Surely would lik a refund.
2470,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small The shirts are very short compared to most that i have ordered. They also ride up if you have a lot of movement.
2471,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not that good. Fitted waist band but everything else was less then desirable.
2472,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Cheap quality These are ok tank tops, but the quality of them isn't very good.  The strings are all starting to come out only after a few wears."
2473,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Too thin Too thin
2474,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Not the best. Pilled after first wash
2475,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Budget friendly It fits snug and is breathable.
2476,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Tear n I’ve ordered five pairs of these leggings all in different colors, and yes; they all fit amazing. HOWEVER. Every. Single. One. Tore right next to the butt crack seam. There’s pictures from others reviews showing it. Every pair tore. What a waste. Definitely invest in better quality. These are not it."
2477,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not what I expected Not quite pleased
2478,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Three Stars Poor quality.
2479,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,A White Sweatshirt Just what I expected left a good deal of room for shrinkage which I assume will occur.
2480,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Three Stars Fit is good. I wish the material was softer. Feels cheap, but it is so that's expected"
2481,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Size To large
2482,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"CHANGE FOR ANOTHER PRODUCT TOP THEY ARE NOT STRETCHY.  THEY ARE SILKY.  DON'T LIKE.  CAN I EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER TOP IF SO I WILL PURCHASE A NUMBER OF STRETCHY XX ROUND NECK LONG SLEEVE STRETCHY TOPS.  I AM 74 AND OFTEN GET CONFUSED WHEN ORDERING, BUT I AM A GREAT CUSTOMER ALWAYS BUYING. JOANNE"
2483,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Rolls up The shirts are nice colors and look great. The feel of the fabric is soft silky and cool. However the wrists are kinda loose for compression and the bottom of the shirt rolls up bad through my day. They need to be streachier and longer.
2484,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Too big Too big for Small..
2485,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not us. sizing even though order bigger size ill ... Not us .sizing even though order bigger size ill give to my granddaughter.
2486,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Horrible material I am very disappointed with the purchase. Material is terrible. Probably recycled. Very thin fabric full of clumps and different shades of white and blue. I am afraid it will not hold after first wash. The pants are already see-through with weird lines that are weaker than other looms. Waist of money.
2487,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Disappointed I didn't care for this dress at all. Felt like I was wearing a tent.  Tight in the chest but very large everywhere else. I was so excited for this dress. I gave it away.
2488,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Ummmm it’s a “No” for Really cute online. Even cuter when it arrived so quickly! Buuuuttttt.... no where near the 4x size that I ordered. I am too heavy and usually order a 3x for extra room, thinking cause it’s online just get the larger and to my disappointment it is really like a smedium and I gave it to my 17 year old and it fits her perfectly and she only wears a large on a regular!"
2489,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Just don’t. Ugliest fit, too thin yet completely unbreathable. Wouldn’t even sleep in this."
2490,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,👎 Very cheap material
2491,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Be careful - ordered twice and second order was not the same product as the first. I have ordered the same size of this product in the past 3 months and the fit was much tighter. I'm the same size now as i was when i first ordered 3 months back, but yet the shipment i received a few weeks ago is not fitting like the first order.  The tags look different altogether. I don't think the second shipment i received was the same make,  this product seems to vary in size based on the material used."
2492,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Runs 1 size smaller order up Order up. Runs small
2493,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Poor Quality Construction I purchased this less than a month ago and the bottom of the zipper is coming loose from the garment.  I have only worn it twice.  It’s ten days past the return date so I am stuck with it.  Would not recommend it.
2494,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star fits weird
2495,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Order larger size Sweatshirts shrunk so bad can no longer wear.
2496,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ran small Disappointed as they ran small.
2497,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not made for human beings Sweater is too wide for any normal sized human being. When it was washed, it shrank vertically, but it stayed the same width, making it even worse. The only reason it got a 2 star is because it is a nice material, just the sizing is horrible"
2498,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Very thin material Kinda odd with the long string to tie. It’s very thin material and it faded after one wash.
2499,1,B076QD9NP1,0,Buyer beware! This product fit very small. The fabric was cheap. There was a center seam down the front of the dress. Terrible. Never again.
2500,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Size chart isn’t true to size Didn’t dislike but small is really small, almost like a child’s garment. Size chart did not help. I had to send back & reorder, and hope this one fits"
2501,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"It’s a great shirt if they would just get the order right  X Ok so I have given these tanks 5 star , and workout wise , Material wise They are fantastic this is the 6th time I’ve bought them and now 3 times in a row I order double X and get triple X. You order double X and they truly are 1 X Fit so I have no clue what’s going on with the company but the shirts are way way to big if they continue to give me triple X and I ordered doubleX ... I also haven’t opened them and set them aside so I’m just now finding out. Open up the package so you know your getting what you bought. This was my previous review This workout shirt is all I wear to the gym 6 days a week, I’ve probably bought well over 20 pair. It’s the best out there and I’ve tried them all. Just remember if your a large get an xl because it’s definitely a tight fit. I’m an xl so the I order the double xl and it fits just right."
2502,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not the compression material I thought it would be Good price just not the compression material I was looking for.  It’s looser than expected.  I have other compression tanks and these don’t come close to smoothing out anything. Okay as a tank top under a button up. But not as a single tank top I would wear to workout in.
2503,2,B0B16Q1854,0,I am very upset  about this order Beautiful color but the belt is sewn back to front
2504,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Runs a bit large Cute but too loose.
2505,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Not that great My dog's hair is very apparent on these. White hair. They are very thin material. They fit a little larger/baggier than anticipated.
2506,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"No compression I gave these tanks one star because they are not what they claim to be.  For compression shirts, there is no compression.  I tried one size and they had no compression . I even ordered the next size down. Still nothing.  A slimmer and shorter fit, but still no compression.<br />If a comfortable tank top is what you're after, then yes, buy these, but if you're looking for compression, do NOT."
2507,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not flattering Not very flattering<br />Fit was as expected
2508,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Inaccurate sizing guide I followed the sizing chart listed by the company. The tanks were too large.
2509,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Comfortable but different waistband I went up a size as recommended by other reviews. I’m 5’9, 160 athletic build and ordered a Large.  They fit well and are super comfy but the joggers I received have a drawstring waistband instead of the flat high waist. I really wanted the flat legging style waist band so that was disappointing. The print is also slightly different than the picture but not in a bad way."
2510,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Not awesome I love the look but i ordered a size large so they would be baggy and they fit like a med. They are not super soft on the inside like most sweats when you first buy them. They also came with a big gap in the seem of my leg.
2511,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Okay but not great The product is okay but the length is a little short and the fit is not a tight as other brands I have worn.
2512,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"1 seam defective out of 3 shirt package. 1 of the 3 tops in my pack unraveled in the first wash.  I thought the seam came out, but upon further investigation, it was just not sewn properly and the edge of the exposed material, outside the seam, it unraveled and then wrapped around various other clothing being washed.  Was a real pain.  Nearly returned the whole lot over this.  I have these laundry protectors, that zip, so started using these to protect the rest of my laundry."
2513,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,fit fit about 2 sizes too small
2514,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Fits Very Small VERY SMALL. I am a med/ large and would get xxl or xxxl if possible !
2515,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"too short! They are true to size, and the fabric feels nice. However, they are short... and I don't even have a long abdomen!"
2516,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not a maxi dress as shown. While I received the SIZE I ordered this was NOT a maxi dress as shown in the pictures.  The photo is clearly a dress that brushes the ground, as a maxi dress should.  This is, at best, a midi dress."
2517,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars the so called fleece made my shirt black from all the lent that came off
2518,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Definitely not sweat proof I bought the Marine blue marl in size small (I’m 5’5 and 145lbs) the fit was PERFECT and super flattering HOWEVER The sweat was super noticeable! I was really disappointed because i thought i finally found a good pair that would hide the sweat, especially because i had read an earlier review that said the marine blue marl was recommended by the company for this specific reason. I’m pretty disappointed. I guess I’ll only wear them for lighter workouts…"
2519,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Very Cute, but Not a Sturdy Dress I wore this dress 3 times and it was very cute, comfortable, flowy - just what I was looking for. The strength of the adjustable straps and the seam that connects them to the dress is very feeble, it broke while in the washing machine. I'd like to order another one, but I wouldn't want to gamble on this happening again."
2520,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Cheap Material Pictures very deceiving. Tried it on and felt very thin and cheaply made

2526,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not that compressed It's not as compressed as I wanted it to be
2527,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Quality isn’t so good. Comfortable, fit is great- but… the seam tore the first time I wore it.  :("
2528,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not for tall people I'm 6'3'' and this (XL) is simply too short for my body. If I raise my arms up all the way it rides nearly halfway up my torso. Also the sleeves are very baggy.
2529,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Description stated that the sizes had been updated to reflect ... Description stated that the sizes had been updated to reflect US sizing. I usually order a large from another company that keeps raising their prices. I ordered a medium for a little extra compression. The medium is something a 10 year old boy would wear. Holding it up to myself, the bottom of the shirt was 3 inches above my waistline. I'm 5'11, 175lbs."
2530,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not for me! Not comfortable in the bust. Different length between the front and the back.
2531,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Didn’t hold up through the wash. These fit awesome straight out of the package. After only only one wash, the upper portion of the tank shrank and the lower portion stretched out to approximately twice the size that it was before. Too bad because the price was right and I was ready to buy more."
2532,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,I received the used ones I received the used ones

2545,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Two Stars I hate the material .. super cheap
2546,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Comes unfinished Looks like it’s probably a cute dress but I can’t try it on to see if it fits because it’s literally unfinished. I’m used to the clothing I purchase to come complete and ready to wear but this dress is literally not connected from the front to the back. Somehow I have to figure out how to thread the strings through the entire back of the dress in order to wear it. Not sure why I should have to construct my own clothing after I paid for a completed garment. Stupidest thing ever.
2547,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"It fits like a tight tank top It fits like a tight tank top, but I really don't feel any compression in th garment. I got this because I gained 40lbls over the last 6-7 months a due to medications.<br />I guess I was expecting the material to be similar to a tank top on top, but not just spandex on my stomache and waist.<br />This did nothing to help in me look better in my clothes or making my pants fit better.<br />I feel like if I lose about 10 more lbs on my diet, I'll throw them away."

2552,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"Sizing is inconsistent I bought this dress and the Cat print dress both in the largest size available (12-13 years old) as my daughter is tall for her age (9) and usually wears a 14-16. The cat print one barely covers her behind and the waist in it fits more like an empire dress! The lollipop dress (same size, brand, etc mind you), fits perfectly! I am really frustrated at the difference in fit! However, my daughter loves them both, so she will wear the cat print dress as a top with leggings."
2553,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,The left sleeve is patterned a little weird. The ... The left sleeve is patterned a little weird. The Material seam is on the outside instead of the inside of the shoulder.
2554,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Nice tanks but coming apart already I’ve not had these long and have not worn them much with all my other tank tops I have. But I noticed today that the seams for the armholes are coming in done and the time to return them has just passed🤷‍♂️
2555,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not very warm It’s not very warm no warmer than a basic sweatshirt
2556,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Compression not felt I bought this item for a little compression but the material does not compress. Other then that it's good to workout.

2558,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not Compression, but comfortable They are fine for tank tops, but they are not compression, at all."
2559,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Good value, bad sizing, bad order picking I ordered XL based on the size chart expecting it to still be tight. I usually wear a medium in tops. They are loose, but could work for certain purposes. However, one of three long sleeve shirts is a short sleeve T-shirt and is gigantic. I will be returning. Good for the price if you get what is ordered and pick the right size."
2560,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Good quality but tooo big!!
2561,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Black polo sweats But initially has two holes in the seam of the right leg inner and outter
2562,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Not for me The material was thinner than what I thought it looked like on the picture.<br />Probably great for warmer weather because of how thin the dress was.
2563,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Very thin material Cheap material.  Wish I had returned for a refund on time.
2564,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,look elsewhere it doesn't offer any more compression than a normal undershirt would.

2567,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not like the picture The dress is not what it seems in the picture. In the picture the dress is long. When i got it and tried it on the dress was a little below my knees. Im a lil disappointed
2568,3,B009R09Z8W,0,I like this hoodie but... I like this hoodie fits well nice thick hood I would’ve gave this hoodie 5 stars if it was a little thicker. That’s just me I like my hoodies thick
2569,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Not at all as pictured.  Barely goes past the knee. Looks and fits aweful.
2570,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Don't buy a size up. The description said to buy a size up but I knew that I wanted it really snug so I bought a large which I typically go with and it was barely snug.
2571,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Super sheer and tighter than expected. For the price, it's hard to find things to knock on this purchase. Especially with name brand alternatives costing as much as they do, this was acceptable. Definitely tighter than I anticipated, and thinner in the fabric than I was expecting. I'm 6'2&#34; and 200 pounds (size 32 waist) and an XL was a struggle to get on and off, but wasnt uncomfortabl while on. Also, you'd think that this was sent via pack mule. I mean, good god. This literally took almost a month to recieve. Thank God I wasn't ordering insulin from these guys."

2575,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Fabric is thin Not really compression. Fits the body nice but is super thin
2576,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Soft fabric- too big at bottom of shirt Loved open shoulders, back and length of shirt. For me, the bottom of shirt was cut too wide and I decided to return the shirt.. If it’s helpful- I ordered a medium; am 5’10”; 135 lbs; 34A."
2577,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Okay for price thinner than expected. A little clingy
2578,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"runs large I think medium is the new large,  it must make people feel skinnier, not impressed."
2579,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Not what u ordered I ordered black, I got grey. Sweats are comfortable but afraid to order more not knowing what color I'm gonna get."
2580,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Runs small I bought size based on reviews but maybe I like my dresses looser because i went with what most reviewers my size said and it was too tight. It said true to size and I picked the recommended size for me. Unfortunately, I lost track of it and wasn’t able to return in time. If you are busty and don’t like super tight fitting clothes, I recommend sizing up at least one or two sizes."
2581,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"always liked their material Comfy sweater, always liked their material; thin, keeps warm and long lasting material."
2582,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Nice color and shape but a bit lightweight Good for the price but quite lightweight.  I have not worn them to the gym as yet.  Need to wear a sport bra with them for sure.
2583,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Look closely Not exactly I thought it would look like. So that was my mistake.
2584,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Print is nothing like the photo The dots are huge bright white circles, looks nothing like the print shown in the photograph. The dress advertised also looks higher quality with different colored piping around the top. The pockets were oddly low. Ended up returning."
2585,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Good quality but somewhat too large.
2586,1,B0928FSGGD,0,"Doesn’t fit the same! Each shirt is a different shape or size, I love the black one I have it fits the best but the blue and grey one is the same size the tag says but they fit way different they constantly ride up and the arms are just weird and the seam of the under arm just digs into the arm pit’s. I just don’t get it why does one of three that are supposed to be all the same size fit better then the other two. Very unfortunate buy!"
2587,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Must come from China I ordered an xl i wear a size 12 and couldn't get them past my knees. Im also 6' 2 . They are super short.
2588,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Very thin material Thin material
2589,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Fit good, but one shirt was used. One of the shirts smelled like sweat, real bad."
2590,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Not compression These shirts are nice for what they are but in no way should they be considered compression unless you buy three sizes smaller than your actual size and for that you can just go buy any shirt.
2591,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Dri Power does not mean DRY QUICK Fits great, Looks good but don't expect it to dry quickly if it gets soaked.  50% cotton is still a sponge."
2592,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Thin fabric Fabric is a little thin. Lighter colors need a slip underneath is a must....
2593,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,NotFo Not as described. Not fleece lined for cold weather wear just a dri fit shirt
2594,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars When the shoulder is too big
2595,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Russell brand not what it used to be!! I like the fit of this shirt how ever a lot of detail that Russell brand used to do they are not doing anymore, for example they do not put the Russell embroidery logo on the sleeve anymore, and they do not feel as heavy as they used to be.  I found out that Warren  Buffet or Berkshire Hathaway is now the owner of Russell brand, I guess putting profit margin ahead of quality is the way they do things...  I wish Proctor and Gamble would buy this brand, then I know for sure it would be well made."
2596,2,B009R09Z8W,0,"The hoodie fit more like a 4XL The hoodie fit more like a 4XL, what concerned me most was the material felt thin and wasn’t very heavy. I return the garment without problem because I need a much heavier hoodie"
2597,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Cute but WAY thin Super cute but WAY thin like spandex. She’s wearing a tank top shorts and a petty coat. It’s like paper thin.
2598,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars A little more high cut than I expected
2599,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"Totally dissappointed. They have change the quality of this item since NOV2017.  No longer a heavy jersey knit.  It is light weight and almost see through, and smaller than they used to be for the same size.  I have tried twice in a month, and I tired of return shipping.  DONE!"
2600,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Super soft I had a lightweight Russell sweatshirt for several years and decided I needed a new one. It is super soft, is very large for me but that's how I wanted it to fit, I thought it was perfect for me. The first time I wore it I realized that both pockets were coming apart at the top. I hadn't even put my hands in the pockets when I noticed they were undone but I was on vacation and had to choice but to wear it. I still will buy Russell sweatshirts but I will check the pocket seams before I intend to wear it."
2601,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Three Stars Nice sweatshirt, just to big"
2602,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Nothing All
2603,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Charged me twice for the same item. The product is of fair quality. I was charged twice for the shirts and only received and order one set!  BEWARE! The company is located in China gave me a boiler plate response and told me to contact Amazon in USA to resolve. Good luck with that.
2604,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"TOO small the sizing was way to small, and there was not much stretch to it.  I'm 5ft 4"" & 176 pounds. I usually order XL and this was more of a small."
2605,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Loosens as you work out I expected the material to make the fit more tight. At the top of my belly button area, the material loosens as you work out. Im usually a Medium and eith these pants I feel a size Small would have bit better."
2606,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Never even had a chance to wear it once! AWFUL! I wanted to love this dress, but never got the opportunity to even try it on! The dress was torn under the armpit straight out of the package!"
2607,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,legging review heavier then expected so I felt hot in them.  would not buy another pair
2608,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Size not true
2609,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Pretty but.. This is a cute dress! The material is pretty clingy and thin :(
2610,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"2* for inaccurate product description... Nice tank tops! However, item description is inaccurate.  There is absolutely no &#34;compression&#34; in this top. They are just good active wear top. I purchased in a small as I need compression fit for my back which I did not get. But, for a tank top, the small fits me perfectly! I'm 5' tall, 125lbs, 32DD, measurements for sizing purposes, at this moment in time 37-26-38."
2611,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Three Stars Okay, but thinner than sweat shirts were made in the past"
2612,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star It was too large. Didn't fit.
2613,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,True to size Dress could be a little longer but it's acceptable.
2614,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"I normally take an xl size sweatshirt. Reading the ... I normally take an xl size sweatshirt.  Reading the reviews of this product, I was led to believe that it is a quality product with sizing problems. A vast majority of the reviewers said that not only are these shirts larger than stated by size; they are larger by 2 to 3 times.  So instead of ordering a xl, I ordered a medium.  Well I barely got it on. And the strange part was that although the body of the sweatshirt was too tight, the armholes were for a size 2x (a size I wore for years).  The outcome is a shirt that looked really tight with sleeves for a 3x size.  So even if you get the correct body size, you'll notice that the arm opening and the length of the sleeve is for a big, tall person.  Consequently I had to ship them back."
2615,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,I won’t buy these again Product is too small I ordered a 3X and receive what felt like an extra-large
2616,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars It's color for me is not that good
2617,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Very Baggy Got one size too big according to chart and the shirts swallowed me. Could’ve fit myself 3 times inside.
2618,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not a support shirt No support at all
2619,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Constant ride up Oh nope to slippery don’t stay down felt sloppy don’t use them for sure not getting more
2620,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"what I received was a great fit and was very comfortable I ordered the Neleus athletic white 3 pack. I received a single blue tank branded &#34;Tesla&#34;. I am in the process of returning it.<br /><br />That said, what I received was a great fit and was very comfortable.<br /><br />Will update this when I receive the proper product."
2621,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"There was a small hole on one of the shirts, disappointed :(  "
2622,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Order Large I ordered a size up the sleves run short and shrink when dried other wise they would be half up the forearm if I hadnt ordered a size up.  I do like the colors and flow of the mid section of sweater
2623,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"NOT COMPRESSION!!!! Absolutely NOT compression shirts! Just a very nice work out tank! It’s comfortable, breathable, stretchy, but not compression. I’m a welder so I have been wearing these shirts under my welding shirts. I got a size smaller (I usually wear a Small, but got the XS) fits nicely!"
2624,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars real comfortable but i ordered an XL and got an XL but it fits like a 3XL
2625,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Thanks for the nope, nope, nope Do you love it when your butt cheeks melt together and form one massive uni-butt? Then these are your go-to leggings. Soft, supple and they will melt your cheeks together. Don’t worry, they won’t look anything like the photo on your athletic physique. Just when you thought the uni-butt was all these had to offer, there is more. The fastest way to turn heads at the gym, squat in them and show everyone that rump you thought you might be able to hide. These leggings are good at showing off what you have to offer! Since you wont be able to pop a squat, or really move without the high waist dropping like its hot and rolling down your abs…these are probably best worn at night in total darkness and you can enjoy them standing still."
2626,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,I returned back Not bad but I don’t like it
2627,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"They don't compress. Not even a little bit. I bought them figuring that if they didn't, I'd still have a few more tank tops, so I'm not too disappointed, but they definitely don't compress as advertised."
2628,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Fleece Crewneck. This sweatshirt is TOO BIG.  Sleeves are baggy.  Shoulder seams are too low on the arm.  Not very flattering.  Had purchased this as a Christmas present.  Wish I could return it.
2629,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Lack of compression based on size chart. Based on my purchase, I would say to buy a size smaller I ordered based on the sizing chart, and my shirts are a bit big. They do not compress anything."
2630,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Should of got a small
2631,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Biggest dislike was the polka dots Biggest dislike was the polka dots. I really liked them on the model, but when I actually got the dress the polka dots were much bigger than expected and nothing like the cute little dots on the pictured model. Also was not expecting the dress to be a high-low. Again it was different than the actual picture."
2632,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Quality So the dress is really a 5 except I didn’t even get out of my house before the strap broke. Love the look, fit and everything about it. Quality not so much. Fabric is even ok. Just needs to be sewn better."
2633,2,B07XD71F1H,0,SEE THROUGH This thing is literally see through. No one wants to buy a cute dress for school and then have to wear a slip under it. I mean sure its comfortable and cute but its only comfortable if you don't mind wearing it alone and having everyone know the brand of your underwear.
2634,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Runs small Too small. Returned.
2635,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs big Comfy shirts. I ordered a medium cause that is what I buy at the store. These fit more like a large. With them being larger than I expected I don’t get the compression fit.
2636,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not Compression The shirts appear to be in good condition and are form fitting. That said, they are certainly not compression shirts. I wear compression shirts for discrete back support under my shirt, so I have others. I got these because it was time to replace a few before gardening season starts. I am wearing one right now. While the fit is snug, but stretchy enough to be comfortable, it is not truly a compression garment. If that is your need, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
2637,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Bad fit This was the worst fitting dress on me. Maybe it's because I have boobs, but it wasn't good. I sent it back."
2638,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,One Star These are NOT a 3XL
2639,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Three Stars Beautiful dress, very tight across the bust"
2640,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"These fit large, not true to size, material is see through Jersey mesh. These come in a pack of three. One of the three had a bad snag in it before I even took it out of its package. As other reviewers stated, these are a very thin Jersey material. I personally don’t like the fit at all. They are much larger towards the bottom which is annoying and makes the fit look huge. Not practical for working out in as the material wouldn’t hold up."
2641,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Shiny fabric Fabric is shiny, almost like a baiting suit."
2642,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Runs small This pack of 3 men's tank tops run small. I ordered a large which is my sons true to size and they are too small. Returning them.
2643,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,not not proportionate
2644,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"One Star very poor quality, and took forever to arrive."
2645,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Small fit... The size was a bit small. The XL usually fits me but I guess this material runs small.
2646,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"She liked the tshirt type material and said its light Runs small.  Got as a gift, she said it was very tight in the arms.  She liked the tshirt type material and said its light."
2647,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not at all Gymshark dupes like many reviews state I will say that these are more stretchy than gymshark leggings but they have weird extra material in the crotch area. They’re not sweat wicking so I would wear these on an arm day or just for lounging in. They are cute though!
2648,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Cheap material The material is cheap and it ripped within a couple of wears.
2649,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Great leggings but do NOT get the black pair I started by ordering a few pairs of the blues and purples. I decided to order a black pair but unfortunately I have to return them as they are NOT squat proof. I’ve only had this issue with the black pair. Which sucks cause I love black
2650,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not good. Lint from the lining is still coming off after 6 washings,  have to use as a work shirt.  Outside of that,  I guess it's OK."
2651,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,One Star Not true size alot smaller
2652,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Worth buying... Shirts are pretty good. They are a little tight at the top and rather loose at the bottom. If you are built like that then this the shirt for you.
2653,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Very small Excessively small for what it was described as.
2654,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Too laaaarge! tooooo large for me
2655,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Lovely lightweight summer dress! Lovely dress, especially for vacationing in warmer weather. Fabric is light...but may be a bit see through for some.<br />Overall, a good find!"
2656,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars The polka dots were pretty big
2657,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not Compression tanks At All Not sure why they're called ""compression.""  I bought to wear under dresses/blouses that show my bra straps. I kept them for that reason alone. A tad disappointing though.  I would not recommend."
2658,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Just No… Worst sweats I’ve ever bought! First the color is horrible, the grey is a dirty drab looking grey not at all attractive looking. They feel like a recycled material, scratchy and rough. The very first wash they got those little balls all over them!! See photo, no not the heather look that’s the little fabric balls from the wash! The cheap logo is the only part that held up so far. Would not recommend or ever purchase again. Not worth the money at all."
2659,3,B09M6X79V9,0,order larger than it says Runs very small
2660,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Vital 2.0 Black Marl The vital 2.0 black marl are very see-through when you bend over. Like extremely see-through that i couldnt show a picture. Its like an xray.... the legging material is very comfortable and soft but unfortunately cant wear in public. 🫣
2661,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Lindo Muy ligero y cómodo . Color fiel a la foto. Compré talla S y me quedó perfecta.
2662,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Good hoodie Great hoodie, the only complaint is the part that goes around the wrist is very big. The sleeves keep going over my hands. This is the only hoodie I own that does this, and I have a lot"
2663,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No compression at all Product is not as described.  No compression at all.
2664,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not a compression garment Light weight, soft tank top. Very thin material. Not any type of compression garment though"
2665,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Good product but way too slippery! Runs small. I should've ordered a size up.
2666,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not sure about the cut or design is off? Material is thin. Not sure how durable it is.  My problem was its cut/fit. It rubbed on my pectoral muscles oddly. Not comfortable at all in that area. Returning unfortunately as these look cool!
2667,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Did not work out for me. I have been training hard for the past few months at the gym. For info, I have a 18.5 in shoulder width, 40.5 inch chest and 32 inch waist.<br />This shirt did not fit well at all. It was extremely loose at the sides, comfort level is good though.<br />However, due to the ill-fit, I decided to return it. Cannot say that it is a bad item though, because it's my preference to have a better form fitting shirt at the gym. Others may like this due to its loose fit and comfortable fabric"
2668,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Too small I ordered a 4xl so it would be a little loose, the tag says that its the right size, but it fits a medium size person just right and too small on me"
2669,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"not much compression I'm 5'8"" 205#.  I ordered Large and they're not very tight. I would say they run pretty true to size. Don't order larger than you'd normally wear or it won't compress you.  I'd try a Medium next time."
2670,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Muy regular No me gustó, me quedó muy grande a pesar que uso esa talla. No la pude usar"
2671,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Burgundy rubs off on clothes I’ve washed these a million times, used shout color catchers, set with vinegar etc. The white and black shirts are fine, but the burgundy one I used the most under my white scrub top rubs off color. Disappointing because I have to hide tattoos under my scrubs and this is a perfect match to my burgundy pants! Great shirt as long as you don’t wear anything over it, and don’t even think about wearing a lighter color bra."
2672,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Good if you're looking for a regular shirt This is not a true compression shirt. It fits loose and gets looser as time goes by.
2673,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Two Stars Doesn't look like the same colors, as in pic. Very thin and cheaply made."
2674,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"USED AND DIRTY I ordered this as a Brand new shirts, but they sent me the Dirty used once. The shirts were sweaty. Do not recommend to anyone."
2675,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Runs real small Plan on returning them I ordered a size bigger and the are to small!
2676,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Me llego manchada Me llego la camisa blanca manchada.
2677,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Muy peq Muy pequeno
2678,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"At your own risk There are dark ink spots all over the white print. Makes them look like they're moldy, honestly. And in case you missed it like I did, they are hand wash, air dry only. I recommend finding something different."
2679,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Size up! The style is nice. Material is VERY thin! I expected a little bit better quality.
2680,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Size runs small I was smaller than I thought and was very clingy
2681,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Run big Runs big. Didn't like them at all. And very thin material. Fake polo
2682,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"See through! I purchased the gray merl because it was listed as being squat proof. You can see my underwear through them without even squatting.. so definitely not squat proof. Overall I do really like the color and even tho you can even see skin through it, since it’s not a solid color you can’t really tell. I was stuck between getting a small or a medium because I am a size 2-4 in jeans but have thicker thighs, so sometimes smalls don’t work for me. I ended up getting a small and they are tight but still comfortable to wear. They might’ve not been so see through if I had gotten a medium, but I do like the compression. The pattern is flattering on the legs, but I think they fit odd in the butt. Again, could be because I got a small but felt like it gave me a flat pancake uni-butt. I like them, but won’t wear them for leg day. Might buy another color and size up!"
2683,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Fit, comfort and style! The look and feel of product"
2684,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not ""Long"" I ordered these because the item name listed them as ""Long"" tanks. They are actually shorter than most of my workout tanks. Keeping them only because it's a pain to return things - but if you are a taller person these will be crop tops on you."
2685,1,B0B16Q1854,0,This product sucks. I hated these pants. I will not get them ever again and neither will anyone else. They suck!!!!!
2686,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Dissapointed I would have gave this five stars but I got a package of 3 shirsts. 2 was perfect but the 3rd shirt was a different material which made it a different fit. It was loose fit. The tags are also different. I would love to order more but how do I know I won’t get 3 bad shirts. A little dissapointed
2687,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Sizing issues This garment is sooooooo badly sized I can't believe it!  In fact, I must say that I repeatedly run into this problem with clothes bought on Amazon.  I contend that this dress, in any shop in America would be labeled &#34;medium&#34; and a rather scant medium at that.<br />I just keep wondering why it is so hard to create a standard size chart so that the clothes we buy on line, and can't try on.  It is CRAZY!"
2688,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Way too small Way too small, These are all full of material is very cheap. Unless you’re a small skinny guy these are gonna look awful on you🤮"
2689,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Disappointed Wore once and the thread came out from thigh area also pocket area. So now have sew it back up!  Not worth hassle sending back. Definitely don't fit like a XLG especially with wider hips. Basically NOT WORTH BUYING!  very disappointing
2690,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Picture is deceiving This is very short in the back and smaller than size than a medium. Luckily it is for my daughter and I am hoping it fits in the back since she is shorter but an average adult it is short in the back. Very thin too
2691,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not so happy about it Lindt came out ofter one wash.
2692,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Do not buy this unless it's for a flying squirrel costume. Took absolutely forever to arrive like 10 days for PRIME and it's freakishly large in the arms. Looks like bat wings, I doubt it's even authentic it's that ridiculous. I could wear this for halloween. Now I have to PAY TO RETURN IT. Seriously?"
2693,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not Compression Shirts I have a 40 inch chest and got medium. They are not substitutes for Under Armor. There is no compression.
2694,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Very dissatisfying! Material is too thin and ferls so cheap....almost like a plastic feeling but thinner version
2695,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,Okay It’s all right.<br />I thought it comes with a bra based on the pictures.
2696,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Mala calidad Pierden muy rápido su compresión
2697,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars not bad
2698,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Compression? Didn’t make a difference. Usually wear XL, bought medium. Tight, but does nothing"
2699,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Tiny! I am a large in all pants but these are miniature! Length was a little short but I could barely fit a leg in them. Are these for kids?? There is about 4 inches of fabric to cover the butt.
2700,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Different sizes are different fabric I ordered this in 2 sizes for my wife. The dresses were 2 different fabrics.!? The smaller size was a great quality material, smooth and soft with a perfect amount of stretch but was a little to tight. No problem. The larger size should be just right. Nope! Less stretch, cheap screen printed pattern that showed the white base through the print as it stretched, rougher texture. Had to return both. If the larger size had been the better quality fabric, this would have looked spectacular on her. I'm sad."
2701,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Arms WAYYY to big but.. The colors on this sweater are very vibrant. But I only got it today so I'm not sure how we will hold out when I wash it. But I was disappointed in the sickness of the sweater. For $30+ you would think it would have a Hanes type feelings but it doesn't it's pretty thin. I am a woman's large so I was going to get a men's medium but I'm so happy I didn't. I got the men's XL for looser fit but the arms are way too big. It's like a men's 2XL on the arms in The width though but lengthwise it fits fine considering I have short arms. So if you want a loosefitting sweater get a 2 sizes bigger but for a tightfitting Switter get one size bigger. And the neck is tight even on an XL
2702,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not comfy at normal size After reading reviews, I bought medium because many people said they run big. Not the case. I'm 5&#34;10&#34;, 165 lbs, and they shirts are too short in my opinion. They sit right below my waist. If that's what you're looking for, then order your normal size. If you want it to be bigger and roomier because it's intended to be a comfy sweatshirt, order a size up."
2703,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Fine Not great, not bad."
2704,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Do not buy! dont put it in the wash.. the coloring comes off and ruined my other clothes
2705,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Cute, but terrible quality, returned item Dress arrived with tears in the seam. Ended up returning it. Wanted to love it though, the dress was cute, just poor quality"
2706,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Runs small. Make sure to order a size up. Made small.
2707,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Too short Too short, material not the best quality"
2708,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Saludos Es un poco incómoda al colocármela.
2709,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars Shrinks after one wash and dry.  Cheap material.
2710,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Thieffs They sent me just 2 t-shirts. 1 was missing and I didn’t like the quality
2711,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Trash! Trash! Fabric is not as listed. Doesn't even have a normal tag....tag and shirt looks like something off of Wish
2712,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Stained shirt I’ve order these shirts twice and the white shirt on both orders had a large stain on the front.
2713,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Fell apart quickly These quickly began coming apart at the seams in the wash. They are complete trash.
2714,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Pretty color and warm, but doesn't wash well It pilled up in the first wash, hadn't even worn it yet. It is still nice and will wear it, but disappointed in the fabric."
2715,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Good quality for great price For this low price, you really can’t beat this set. Good stretch and comfortable. I expected it to be a bit more compression than it was, but I’m still happy with my purchase."
2716,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Alright Ordered a medium and felt like a Extra large
2717,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Cheap! Just like pictures of everyone else, mine fell apart at the string tie area and the stitch on the side.  Cheaply made. I am super sad because they are long enough 😪 but falling apart.  1st time wearing them."
2718,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Ok It wasn’t what I expected other than that it’s fine just not for me
2719,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not as good as the short sleve. The material is almost completely different from their short sleeve shirts. And the size fits smaller as well. I bought the short sleeve vneck and crew shirts and I think they're great but the long sleeve feels cheaper and runs smaller. Not certain how that works?
2720,3,B09M6X79V9,0,NOT a built in bra I got the impression this had a built in bra but it doesnt. They look nice if you want a stretch cami.<br />Ordered “same day delivery” and it came as promised.
2721,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Pretty dress. Tight at chest. I bought the XXL size hoping it would fit, but it’s just too tight. The rest of the dress fit wonderfully but I felt like one sneeze and I’d rip the dress wide open."
2722,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star It was tiny!! Unwearable.  I donated it to charity.
2723,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star is Russell full zip fleece.is wrong . want the uniqlo .ok Thanks
2724,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Seam runs down the front of the dress. The dress was sewn wrong, I’m assuming. The seam runs down the front. :( It’s very noticeable with the polka dot pattern. I recently had surgery and needed something comfortable to lounge around my home so I kept it."
2725,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Runs small I wear a L/XL, ordered XL and it runs tight. Also, note the ""halter"" part is basically string that doesnt pull all the way into the material and shows. Its cute, but cheaply made."
2726,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Didn't like the material Sent back, a bit too snug and didn't care for the material. Loved the colors tho!"
2727,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cute yet non-compression Cute and it matches everything. However, the compression is non-existent. I want to feel like a can of biscuits when I wear compression tops."
2728,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not meant for bodies in-progress, uneven compression The “army green marl” and the “charcoal grey marl” colors are amazing. My favorite color of olive style leggings yet! I wouldn’t usually even consider a gray pair of leggings (because I’ve seen them on other women and just feel like they’re a bit too revealing for me) but the charcoal gray style has so much heather/marl pattern I thought they were perfect— stylish and modest coverage!<br />I’m in between L/XL sizes and I ordered an XL and thought it fit well. They felt like the right size and were very comfortable.<br />The fit of the leggings is where the love ends for me though. I’m in the process of losing weight and I have a proportional figure but I need compression to feel comfortable. These leggings didn’t have even compression throughout the fabric so they looked awful on me. The waistband is thick and nice compression but where the leg material transitions at the hip it’s not as compressed. So it compressed my midsection and made my hips look a lot fuller than they are in reality (like rubber bands around the middle of a watermelon).<br />The % of nylon in these leggings gave me an embarrassing camel toe. They need more spandex in the material so the material doesn’t sit in the creases of the groin.<br />I’m super bummed these didn’t work out. I did return them but I would purchase again from this vendor if they update the products. Even my husband loved the look of them in the package but they just didn’t work for my in-progress body. They look great on already very fit women!"
2729,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"I wished the gray part was a bit longer as the picture shows it hitting her mid-thigh but mine only came to like my waist As is. I wished the gray part was a bit longer as the picture shows it hitting her mid-thigh but mine only came to like my waist. I am a petite woman (4&#34;11, 120 pounds) Feel is nice."
2730,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Returned. Too small. Material is not as described.  Short on me as a 5'4"" person."
2731,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"No Stretch! The description says the dress has ""some stretch"" but the dress has zero stretch. It has a rayon look and feel."
2732,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not what you think I did not know the product was mesh like in its fabric. I thought it was going to be a solid material and I’m honestly pretty disappointed about that. I would not have made the purchase if I knew that. It’s quite difficult to see in the pictures posted. Just feel sad about it.
2733,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Cheap feel and appearance not worth the $$ The fabric is cheap and the print is faded. The craftsmanship is very low quality. I should have returned it immediately
2734,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,It's fine. Wear it at work. It's fine.
2735,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,It is definitely not a compression underwear. It is definitely not a compression underwear. It does not help shaping your body it is just tight tank top
2736,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,It’s a beautiful summer dress Loved the dress. It super comfy. But it is too long. All long dresses are made for tall people
2737,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Gathered at waist. Too old school. No thx Eh
2738,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Disappointed. Not the quality I was expecting for the price The reason for the 1 star and disappointment was after one wash the inseam on one of the legs is coming undone. And I didn’t put them in the dryer, I hung them up to dry. I haven’t even worn them except to try them on.  Other than that, the material is a little scratchy but a nice thick fabric. Also, I’m 4’11” and about 150lbs. I’m usually a medium/large or 8-10 with pants. These came out the package with no room for any shrinkage that may happen in the dryer. And the “stretch” of the fabric is closer to what you would’ve found in the 90s before spandex, leggings, and jeggings took over. Which is great, but the stitching in the seams is a total disappointment."
2739,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Getting a hole in the middle of the chest area. I have had this for some time now and have worn it about 15 times and it already has a hole developing in it right in the middle of the chest.  I think I may have just got a poor quality this time because My other hoodies from this brand are all OK.
2740,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not bad but pick your regular size A bit disappointed because upon looking at all the reviews saying it fit like a second skin I got an extra size up. Not a good idea, too big for me. Shld have stuck with my true size and been much happier. Not a bad material and still serves its purpose but was hoping for a more tighter fit. I'm 6'2, 225..tried a 2x..."
2741,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Russell Athletic sweat shirt Russell Athletic always was a good product. These new sweat shirts I bought were extremely heavy and I really didn't like the heavy fleece lining
2742,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Roll up It was great  except after I washed and wore itca few times the bottom end keeps rolling  up
2743,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Not similar to their other ""no pocket"" pants I bought this pair after purchasing other pairs of these joggers without the pockets. I purchased the same size and these pants do not fit the same - they unfortunately don't fit right -- not enough fabric on the buttocks. I would also say they are not as comfortable as other pairs. Also, after one wash the metal around the drawstring came off. So I will not be purchasing these again."
2744,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not flattering Waist band is not flattering.
2745,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Wish I could love these! After reading other reviews I decided I was fine with the lack of compression and just thought it was a good deal on a pack of undershirts, but they are not very long and the silky material rides up quite a bit, so they're not even great for that. Maybe for someone shorter they could be great!"
2746,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Wrong size. Received product in a timely manner. Seem to be well made. However, I ordered large. I received two large and one extra large."
2747,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs very small Order up one or two sizes<br /><br />Have to my daughter.  Just way too small
2748,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Runs small Nice dress runs a little small. Seams are a little light should be black.
2749,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not long enough for me I wish they would have been longer.  Wouldn’t purchase again.
2750,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,One Star Does not do a thing for your waits
2751,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars to long for a little woman
2752,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Cute but cheap It’s cute, but the fabric is cheap and it flares out a bit around my hips. I’m 5’9 160 and ordered a large."
2753,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Scratchy Not the material I was looking for.  Sizes aren't standard (order next size up to two sizes larger).
2754,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Terrible quality Cheapest quality shirts I’ve ever purchased.
2755,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Two Stars tighter than I would have hoped for an XL size.
2756,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Super large polkadots Misleading. The polka dots are much larger than pictured. Still one of my fave dresses though.
2757,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Itchy fabric The fabric is not very comfortable.  It works for working out but wish I could wear all day.  I would go up in size next time.  It fits tight.
2758,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not great Didn’t really work out
2759,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Runs small Runs super small.. I normally wear a 2x to allow wiggle room so I ordered a 3x to allow for washing shrinkage and it's really about a XL... It's cute on the model but not true to size.
2760,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Small and short, but still okay. I ordered this 2 sizes bigger than mine, and it fits pretty snug. Also, not nearly as long as it looks in the picture.<br />It's still really comfortable and cute, just runs small."
2761,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Loose. Not very tight. Too loose.
2762,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"The pattern is nice ! I love the pattern but i didn’t like the neck halter , I was expecting the string will be on the back but it is on your right arm side , the black color is very light seems like you wore many times and the color got off ."
2763,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,... large and have received a medium which fits much better.. we've returned the large and have received a medium which fits much better...
2764,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Runs small The pants are so soft! They fit like leggings, very tight and kinda pull on the crotch, across making it a tad un-flattering. If you are above 5’8 they will also be shorter."
2765,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"One Star It said to order a size larger, so I ordered a 5x..  it's not 5x.. it's more small/med."
2766,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Order a full size larger than you want Ok quality. Fits really small
2767,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Used item shipped as new Item was in a non-factory bag,  tags missing,  SOILED (grease spots on the chest) &<br />obviously was previously worn by someone!.<br />Very disappointed."
2768,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Beware! Excessive length on sides! I’m 5’5” and ordered a size large. The length of this dress on the sides are excessively long. They measured 46” from UNDER THE ARM. The measurement from the straps partially adjusted was 54”. The sides were dragging on the floor by about 3”. Returning dress. Bummer because it’s really cute!
2769,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression! These are not compression at all! They are very thin see through fabric, falsely advertised and a wate of money!"
2770,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Nope This is a terrible fit! Got it for my fiancé to replace his current crew neck pullover and it didn't work at all. Sleeves were really long and bunched up. I'll-fitting, unflattering."
2771,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not what I expected The color and material of pattern were not what I expected. I ordered the dusky pink marl and after recieving them I felt that the image used by the company is not a good representation of the actual product that was recieved. I believe I have some cheap look a like of the product. Also these leggings will certainly leave you with a camel toe. I had to return. Not worth the money.
2772,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,3 stars Didn’t help much
2773,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Out of shape hoodie non sense hoodie Please don't buy. Nothing like what u see on the picture
2774,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Three Stars Love the material! Wish it was a little smaller, I guess I need to hit the weights more! Lol"
2775,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Inaccurate web description I ordered the vibrant hot pink sweatshirt and recieved a much lighter pink shirt that looks nothing like what I ordered. Much lighter in person completely different color of pink. The only reason why I didn't send it back is because it's still a nice shade of pink and<br />it's comfortable, the seller did falsely advertise though. I did not receive what I ordered and I can see other people being upset about this. I think it's safe to say that the rest of the color choices would probably turn out the same based off my experience so beware."
2776,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"6Ft, 1, doesn't go below waist but barely. Material a little uncomfortable and it's simply not long enough, sucks honestly,  was hoping it would fit."
2777,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"no what was expected these tanks are see through and of poor quality.  They are not long, and they are not compression anything.  not able to wear as a tank alone, but only as an undershirt"
2778,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Very clingy I love the color. Do not like the fit. Very clingy.
2779,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Runs small The sweatshirt size runs small. It fit okay, but when washed wil be too small."
2780,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Ehhhh!! 😒😒 Not as long on me as the picture.  The colors are wonderful, but took FOREVER TO GET HERE. I ordered the largest size they have and it just fits funny."
2781,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Too small 6,3... XX-l was too small"
2782,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Three Stars Comfortable, but not the compression I was expecting."
2783,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Runs small Do not but in dryer shrinks to tight to get over head and get your arms in
2784,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Good quality Fairly tight! Will definitely keep you warm in the winter on a walk/run
2785,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Cheap fabric The fabric was the only big deal I saw. Light weight for sure. Fits good and love the pockets. I kept this one anywise
2786,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Makes your body look snatched I love these. They are super stretchy and make your body look good. The only thing I will say is it does sometimes give a bit of camel toe/sits off in the front when you are working out. Overall, I love these.<br /><br />Edit: I stopped wearing them after a couple months. They started fitting weird in the crotch and kept rolling down. They weren’t very good to work out in and would show sweat marks."
2787,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Worth it I like how it keeps you cool and it's great for working out
2788,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"3.5 outta 5 seems fair. Started out buying a 2XL. My gf is 5'5 and curvy and I read some reviews saying buy larger size if you're curvy. So my gf is normally an XL so I bought 2XL. They were humongous. Too big too long. The 2XL was so big that we went down to L. The L was way too small. So my thinking is now go XL..which is her true size. The XL and the L are the exact same size. We even laid them on top of each other and the sweatpants were exactly same size. So I go to the sizes for the 4th attempt and I finally notice..there is XL and then there is 1XL. So I purchased the 1XL and it was the right size for her hips, butt, thighs etc..but they look like they are about 3 inches too long. The challenge is finding the correct length for the sizes above a L. My gf doesn't care because they're just lazy pants and the extra length helps keep feet warm. But it was a nightmare trying to size these sweatpants. Other than finding your true size in these..everything else is great! My gf would probably give these a 4 star, but she wasn't dealing with the purchasing and returning and return labels etc..I gotta take half a star away for that part as well."
2789,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,light weight Shorter than I wanted and I short.  The sleeves are longer than I need but it works for he price.  If the material was the same as the sleeves I would purchase more.
2790,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Order 1 size bigger Size run small
2791,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Two Stars Way smaller than suggested
2792,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,... but i guess in winter with sweaters would be good i live in little larger  than im  thought  but  i  guess  in  winter  with  sweaters  would  be  good  i live  in  fl
2793,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Nice hoodie but cuff wear fast Nice hoodie however I have had this item a very short time just days and the cuffs are already showing signs of wear. This is worrisome as a hoodie ought to have a longer life in good condition
2794,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Too small Runs super small. Go a size up
2795,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Too large, decent fabric just oversized"
2796,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not meant for curves. The sizing was way off, and the bottom seam was already fraying. Terrible buy if you have curves!"
2797,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Made literally backwards The vertical front seam is directly down the center (that should be in the back) and the front neck line has the tag on it. I fixed this by chopping the tag off and it looked amazing. Butttttt, then the higher bottom of the dress was high in the back instead of low. Which is annoying, but now the top looks like it actually fits correctly. Shaking my head. Someone really designed the pattern backwards! So bad. Fabric is great though! Professional sheen, and not a knit fabric. No pilling. Good as a house dress."
2798,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Color me disappointed! I was so excited to receive this dress. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it.<br />First of all, (and this might not bother everyone) the seam is running down the front of the dress and the pattern is not matched up. However, there is no seam in the back... I was hoping I could just turn the dress around and wear it backwards but it makes the chest (which is already tight to begin with) fit very weird.<br />Secondly, the dress I got had damaged side seams. I included a photo for reference.<br />The fabric is nice and light but not see through.<br />The length of the dress fit my 5'5&#34; body perfectly.<br />The pockets are an excellent touch.<br /><br />Guess I will have to search elsewhere for a dress that delivers all around."
2799,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Super cute and I loved it but after two wears ... Super cute and I loved it but after two wears the sides began to fray and fall apart and I can't wear it anymore. :(

2802,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Ok for what it is. Not in love Some bleeding on the fabric . A little heavier than I expected for this flowy silhouette . Had to make tom of alterations to fit . Basic casual dress
2803,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Three Stars Material could be better, the sleeved shirts have a better material than these."
2804,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Try something else It was as decorated but they would have but barley a compression shirt I could have just gotten a small t shirt that would have been better and done the job
2805,2,B09M6X79V9,0,To short! These shirt are short. Even ordering a xl to accommodate my chest they sit right at the top of my pants waist. Not what I expected.
2806,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Material is a little cheap! It was ok I will wear it. I just thought it would be a little better quality.
2807,1,B09M6X79V9,0,If you wanted a built in bra this isn't for you. I would have given it a 5 Star the fabric is nice with just the right amount of stretch. I did order a bigger size seeing that they seem to run small. I gave it a 1 Star because I was lead to believe it had a built in bra.<br />That's really too bad because I really wanted to like this Razor tank.
2808,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Toooo Short!!!!! Way to short!!!!!
2809,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Awful I dont like them they dont stay in place

2820,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Cheap. I wore this shirt once and washed it once. Has several holes.
2821,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not well made. These were much smaller and thinner than expected. Wouldn't order them again.
2822,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Pockets are accidentally sewn closed Cute but the pockets are accidentally sewn too small.  Frustrating because I had to open the pocket and resew it.  returned the first  one and second had same issue but with other pocket
2823,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Shipping from CHINA All I can say is this best be a fabulous dress because they are apparently shipping via pony express from China. Had I known that up front I never would have made the purchase. Purchased 4/5, shipped 4/6 and I'm supposed to receive it (ballpark) 4/26 to 5/17. No bueno, sellers. A little more transparency please. If it does end up being fabulous and it really does fit as expected, I'll adjust to 3 stars only."
2824,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Epic failure Sooo dissappointed with most clothing ordered off Amazon. If you run size 6-8 order Large or even XL or product will be skin tight w little give. Strap on one side (untied that you have to knot) is actually what keeps the dress up, you have to adjust it, just doesn’t hold up well. Looks amazing online, fails in person"
2825,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Way too small There is NO WAY this is an extra large. This was a small.
2826,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I wanted to love it, but.... I returned it..fit very strangely.  It smashed my breasts down and was huge everywhere else."
2827,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small Looks good but runs small I ordered a xl and usually wear a large and it was tight
2828,1,B09M6X79V9,0,These tops are are very flimsy You can't work out in them.  I am keeping mine as sleep tops.
2829,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I think it's a cute dress though I like the pockets on the It was a little to big for a medium, it's supposed to fit loose but it's too loose. I think it's a cute dress though I like the pockets on the side"
2830,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Nice material, size up For reference: I am 5'2"", 117 pounds, with long legs and a short torso. Athletic build (narrow hips, bigger thighs). I bought these leggings in grey size XS and marled blue size S. The grey size XS fits me and has good compression which I like, but they are too short on me, and the line that is supposed to go under your butt goes like halfway up my butt, and my butt is not that big. The blue size S is the right length and fits much better. However, the waistband is just a smidge looser than I would like. Overall, not bad for the price though, and I love the material. They are also not sweatproof, but that does not bother me that much. I would buy more colors in the size Small for sure."
2831,1,B076QD9NP1,0,"Cheap Very disappointed, the fabric is so cheap it is see through. I would have returned it, but it was a gift sent across country, so I just sent a replacement from a different store. I will never buy from Jxstar again!"
2832,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Tank tops Nice tank tops for working out, but very thin and see through. No compression by any means."
2833,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star rayon is a terrible fabric choice for this flowy-type dress
2834,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"looks as very low priced for poor people A thin fleece material, lack of accessories details in tailoring, looks as very low priced for poor people"
2835,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Sleeves too short! The sleeves were way too short.  And, the stomach area was at least a size too big for a medium.  The rest fit loosely, but ok.  The material seemed warm and still lightweight.  The short sleeves were a deal-breaker and I returned it."
2836,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,It's a nice look but the cut was very wrong under the ... It's a nice look but the cut was very wrong under the arms and around the chest - I could have done better job in tailoring this kind of dress with knowledge only in geometry
2837,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not a fan Dislike
2838,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Didn’t get what I ordered I didn’t get what I ordered. I ordered a hoodie and what came was a sweatshirt.
2839,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,don't buy or don't wash it with machine I just washed it one time using washing machines and all the fiber came apart. I am very disappointed with product. They should state as hand wash or something.
2840,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Small fit Small fit
2841,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Exactly what I needed but small. It's not true ro size. I can live with it but no room left!
2842,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Poor quality control First sweatpants had the grommet missing at the drawstring waist. Sent it back and received a second pot with the same issue.
2843,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Money Wasted Not true to size at all I ordered 3x and still got asked was this my son shirt I was trying to squeeze into, I laughed but still felt like I wasted my money"
2844,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Nice fit..... but had a stain on it! 😩 Product fit great, unfortunately I had to request a refund as it came with a stain on it."
2845,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Deceiving images. The hot pink with the model in the image was what I thought I was getting, the real hoodie is more than a few shades lighter. Kinda disappointed, but going to keep it just for wear around the house."
2846,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not long enough at waist Short at waist. Picks up a lot of lint
2847,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not crazy about these sweats. Th start with, I don’t really care for the fabric. Probably should have ordered a pair that was all cotton. The elastic in the waist is inadequate and the drawstring being on the inside rather than outside of the pants makes it difficult to tighten."
2848,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star Way to big
2849,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Broken At Seam I loved these leggings. they were very comfortable and great for working out. however i am very dissapointed that they ripped at the seam. if it weren’t for this i would have purchased more.
2850,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star If you have a a large bust this dress will not fit.
2851,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Waste of money for only a year of use. I had these pants for about a year. I LOVED LOVED LOVED THEM. They were a beautiful color and were wonderful to workout in from high intensity to yoga. I washed them accordingly and air dried them. Sadly after a year of only occasional use...they ripped in the worst spot..right in the V. Don’t waste your money.
2852,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Very pretty but didn’t fit Like it but runs small
2853,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Too tight Bought the right size but these are almost like wearing  a compression sock around your breasts and abdomen.  Couldn't even get it on.
2854,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,... bigger men with wide shoulders the quality's not that bad really but not for winter it's a tall hoodie not for bigger men with wide shoulders the quality's not that bad really but not for winter. over all you get what you pay for.
2855,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Two Stars Not really liking the material, but I’ll give it a try"
2856,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Thinner and shorter than it appears It's pretty but not as long as it appears in the picture
2857,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Nice shirt, not great material. I don't care for this sleek material.  It feels weird on my body....doesn't breathe that well for me, personally.  Cute though.  They look nice - sort of large around mid section if you like that.  I don't....I'd prefer them to fit snugly or at least to shape of my bod."
2858,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Not the greatest feeling These remind me of a slightly nicer version of those cheap mesh tanktops you used to wear in the 90s. But the seams are way more uncomfortable.<br /><br />These do not stretch at all. They're just old school mesh with big holes cut in them to air out. Everyone seems to love these so it must just be me, but I thought they were a little uncomfortable. Mostly the seams ruining it on the back for me. Also the tank tops seem to ride up a but in the front, but could be a size thing.<br /><br />I got XL, and i'm 6'3"" and about 225. Probably shoulda done XXL. Returning for something else, not a new size though."
2859,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression! These are not compression tank tops.
2860,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Returned Disappointing to return this. Color not as vibrant as I expected and fit was weird.<br />Light weight material.
2861,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Good Quality for the money A little larger then expected but over all good quality.  Not bad for the money. I would recommend to anyone.
2862,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Blurry print The print was blurry. And the seams dis not match.
2863,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Extremely disappointed Extremely thin!! Not all for winter weather!!
2864,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Inconsistency in sizing and material I have purchased this style of Russel Sweatshirt for many years; medium and in black.  The product is now manufactured in different countries around the world i.e., Thailand, Guatemala, etc...  You never know which country.  I have purchased the product three times through Amazon ( two sweatshirts x three purchases) and the medium sweatshirts have varied in size between countries of manufacturing origin.  One purchase was for two sweatshirts that fit well and the other two purchases were sweatshirts that were over sized; all were ordered in black fabric and medium sized.<br /><br />One also must be careful because the ratio of cotton-to-polyester is also variable i.e., 50 cotton/50 polyester vs 20% cotton/80% polyester depending on country of origin.  That ratio is significant in terms of the feel of the fabric.<br /><br />Given the size and fabric inconsistencies I can not recommend purchasing this product on-line.  You are better of going to your local Sporting Goods Store and trying one on before buying.  It's a burden taking the time to return a shipped item and then following up to be sure your account has been credited."
2865,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Nice color, but it pills when washed. I have this same pullover in black and it washed up fine, but this color pills really bad. Everytime I want to ware it I have to shave it with the Pill remover."
2866,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Fit large and description is misleading The description states:<br />We have revised the size chart for these shirts, They are American standard size now,So you can purchase the shirt according to your normal wear.<br /><br />I followed this guideline and ordered the size I normally do for this type of product and found it to be about a size too large. Not to mention the item title is misleading, as it states that this is a &#34;compression&#34; tank. That gives the impression that it would have a snug or second skin type fit, which even if it had fit as expected seems inaccurate.<br /><br />Fabric is also thinner than it appears in the images.<br /><br />I'd ordered these to wear during workouts, but given they're too lose they're not comfortable for exercising in. I'll likely give them away as exchanging them is a hassle."
2867,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not True plus size This dress is not true plus size. It's very small in the chest area  for a large breast women. Returning item.
2868,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Didn’t last Great fit but got a run in fabric after wearing twice.
2869,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Poor product Not like the picture at all poor quality
2870,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"OK Dress While i like the style of the dress and it is very nice pattern, the fabric is very synthetic feeling and not as stretchy and comfortable as some other dresses i have in this style.  Overall a nice dress though."
2871,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Material is cheap Design on material is nice but Material is cheap
2872,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Light color pink The sweatshirt fits great,but the color is not the bright pink that is in the picture. It’s a light pink. Not what I wanted but didn’t want to send it back."
2873,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression These are just regular tank tops. No compression at all. Not as advertised.
2874,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"What?!? In the photo online it looked like there was a tech issue because some of the flowers were completely white, like it didn’t get printed correctly. Well, that’s exactly how it looks in real life as well! It’s like when it was being printed some of the flowers just got left off completely. It’s very bizarre and does not look good!"
2875,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Color Most ugliest color ever
2876,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"Cheap.  Thin. Wife did not care for the material, cut, or quality.  Returned."
2877,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Decent, but Workmanship is Shoddy I'll start with the good and make my way to the bad. First, I bought this hoodie (dark green) for work as that's the colors of my employer. I work outside year-round so I needed something to keep myself warm during the cold season. For that part, it definitely fits the bill and helps to keep me warm when the cold hits. It's somewhat thick and is warmer than the hoodie that was given to me by my employer so it gets quite a bit of use. The XL fits me perfectly, no complaints as I prefer my shirts to be a bit more loose fitting to allow for flexibility when on the move.<br /><br />The bad? Well, this hoodie was purchased at the end of November and it already has a hole where the wrist cuff meets the sleeve. It's not a hole from abuse, the thread is simply coming undone already. I can likely repair it by sewing it back together but I'm not too impressed with the quality of workmanship after only a month and a half of use. I have other hoodies that I've owned for years that have been through far more abuse and other than typical degradation from years of washing and wearing, are still in decent shape.<br /><br />Second and even more annoying is the string for the hoodie. It's not secured in place like you'd see in others where there's a channel sewn in to keep it from moving around inside the hood. Every time it's washed, I have to fish the string from somewhere inside the hood back to the edge where it belongs. If it weren't for the knots tied to prevent the string from getting pulled out entirely, it would have already. Again, it's pretty easily fixable by hand sewing but this is another example of shoddy workmanship. I guess you get what you pay for and fortunately, I caught this hoodie when the price was low. It makes me wonder if it's a reject.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent hoodie and does the job I need it to which is keep me warm when it gets cold. Had I known about these problems previous to purchase, I probably would have looked elsewhere though."
2878,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Cheap! VERY SMALL, very thin, cheap!"
2879,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Too big, too thin, not amazed Nice color. Material feels a little on the cheap side. Not what I'd usually buy in store. It won't be very warm wearing it"
2880,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very disappointed At 1st glance, I love these tops. Cute, comfortable, nice fit. However, I decided to wash them before I wore them and that pink lining started to separate also there is a lot of string is coming from the bottom line."
2881,3,B0B16Q1854,0,". They fit good ,but they are not long enough how i like my pants to be."
2882,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Poor quality material. Cute dress but the material was a disappointment. The color (black) looks faded
2883,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not worth $30 maybe $10 I bought these yoga pants because of the reviews. Honestly, they are terrible. The fabric is rough and cheap feeling. Pulling them from the bag I realized two things this company said four way stretch? MAKE THEM STRETCH FAR. These were and large and by the sizing chart that should be conservative for my measurements…these could have fit a child. No thank you. Immediately returned."
2884,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Almost great Two of the shirts fit great but one seems smaller than the others.
2885,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Must have a little butt The crotch of the pants top the top of the pants is waaaaay too little. They go half way up. Extremely unportioned.
2886,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Manufacturing Error [[VIDEOID:87f32764f239b2ec7eca1db3952f02a5]] (Please see video to see extra little floppity-floop of material.) Perhaps the Gods bestowed this tank upon me thinking I was a legendary warrior of old, impervious to mortal wounds and wielding a dime-sized-third-nipple that glistened in the sunlight and distracted my enemies — alas, I am but a two nippled mortal so the extra material on this tank just looks like shi. Bummed because I actually love lifting in the other two that came in this pack."
2887,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"terriable very big, faded easy and not warm"
2888,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Ripped They have poor quality when I recievee them they had a whole on the side.
2889,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Holes is the fabric This is the second package I have ordered. The first was perfect. The second however was not. I pulled the red out of the package this morning and pulled it on to find tiny holes all in the side. The other two appear to be fine but this one is ruined. I will be returning.
2890,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Fit is too loose & the lack of lining makes them unattractive.
2891,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Dirty Nice jacket for price but came with dirt on it!

2895,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Too short Bad fit.....too short.....
2896,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Poor quality Quality of this dress is poor. Looks like it’s been already worn.  One wash and it will be all bally
2897,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"leggings came soaking wet When they were delivered, the leggings came soaking wet with several small dark stains on them like rust stains. I washed them and were able to get them out and they fit good but i don’t think i would consider buying again"
2898,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Size up The plum color is everything and I love it. The material is so soft and exactly what I was looking for. I got the XXL and wish they had a size bigger. It kinda tight in the camel toe area, because of that I most likely will look for a different brand. I believe it’s overpriced."
2899,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression tank tops I ordered these bc they stated they are compression,which they are not. All 3 tank tops are diff sizes even though label reads as XL on all 3 of them. I can only fit into one of them. Very disappointed,needed these for vacation. Will be returning these for refund."
2900,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"too large for an adult small! I give this three stars because even though its cozy as advertised, it is too large for an adult small!"
2901,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not for Me I'm 5'7, 34F, anywhere from a 6 to a 10, and I ordered a medium. While I appreciated the adjustable straps, even at their longest length, I didn't like the way the neckline fell with my chest. I missed the description that the front is shorter than the back (which the vendor pictures certainly don't show), which might've been okay, but I just didn't like the way this one looked on me."
2902,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Falls apart The metal rings where the strings go through the pants pull off very easily the fabric seems to be falling apart around it.
2903,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not good Ride up your belly
2904,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Do not buy !!!!!! Terrible product !!!! These shirt are terrible terrible terrible!! The XL is at best a medium and they are cut wrong!!! Highly do not recommend!!!!
2905,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Short in the crotch These look like the photo in terms of colors and design. They are thinner than I was expecting and they are usually short in the crotch. I bought a size larger than I typically wear because I know joggers are meant to be slim fit and I wanted more room. They are roomier in the ankle and calf but still a little tighter than I would like in the butt and thighs. The biggest issue is the crotch, I cant sit without exposing the top third of my butt. I only 5'9 so I dont require tall sizes. Even if I lost 20 lbs this would still be a problem. Got a good deal so I'll probably just give them away to a short relative or friend."
2906,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Size is wrong Size is way off and material for all 3 shirts are different. I was very unhappy with my purchase
2907,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Neleus Men's 3 Pack Dry Fit Y-Back Muscle Tank Top These run a tad small, I bought XXL and they fit like a XL or slightly smaller, the material is rather thin, I do not expect these to last a long time, but they look ok, and are semi-comfortable. I won't be buying these again."
2908,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Product not as pictured Product is nothing like the picture. It stops halfway from knees to ankles, the top of the dress reminds me of a night gown instead of a v-neck cut. The material is thin a cheap... not cute at all!! Returning product"
2909,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,High Rise and Odd Material These are extremely high rise and the material is kind of odd feeling but they don't fall down while you workout. Probably won't purchase anymore.
2910,1,B07XD71F1H,0,The fabric used The material was very thin.
2911,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Run a bit small Nice lightweight material. They run a bit on the smaller side. I am a female and I normally wear a medium in women’s and small in men’s clothing. I purchased these a size larger hoping for looser fit and they fit like a typical men’s small.
2912,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"They lied Not compression at all, pretty loose."
2913,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Decent work out tops Run a little small. Material isn't great, but ok."
2914,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Order a size smaller Wayyyyy to big
2915,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,The material feels cheep looks more like a training bib or penny for sports teams.  It's pretty thin and you can see through it.  Plus it's not soft on your skin.  It's not like they cost a lot.  Now I know why.
2916,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Good, not Great. Wasn't the quality I was expecting. No hard feeling's, it is pretty good."
2917,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Small Somewhat small, if it came in one more size bigger"
2918,2,B09M6X79V9,0,The shirts are thin not enough compression. I didn't like the back straps or the lite compression.
2919,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Unimpressed Would not consider this a “compression” garment
2920,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Smaller fit Order a bigger size than you normally wear because they come in a slightly smaller size
2921,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"I keep trying to wear these.. but they're awkward. I'm 5'7&#34; 145lb (35B chest, 28 waist, 39 hips); Bought the M - The top is awkwardly large in the quantity of material and fits snug to the body (not tight), but the middle is loose/baggy and not in a good way, and then the bottom is tight again. They're also short for me in length, so I can't layer them the way I wanted to. It's an awkward spandex material, so baggy spandex is just a mess of an outfit. I find myself putting these shirts on, trying to make them work, and then taking them off again. The swoop neck is awkward. Something is just off."
2922,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No support This top has no shelf bra and is made of very thin material.
2923,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Worst product ever This was definitely not what I was expecting! I was expecting 3 compression shirts and these are 3 flimsy non compressive peices of material. I will not order this or recommend it to anyone. Very very dissatisfied.
2924,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,It’s more of a T-shirt It was too much like a T-shirt
2925,1,B009R09Z8W,0,I buy a small and receive a xlarge Item did not fit
2926,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ok Comfy but very little compression
2927,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Just regular runner tank tops!! NOT a compression tank top, there regular runner tank tops...."
2928,1,B09M6X79V9,0,too tight I followed the chart and it is way off. I ordered a Medium and it's a tight fit.  My bra size is 36DD so I am returning the product. Not sure I want to order the Large and have the same issue??? Not sure if I will order.
2929,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Misleading Not compression. Not form fitting. Very disappointed
2930,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,"It's ok, but not for me I'm not impressed. I have a small frame and build, but I'm currently breastfeeding so I ordered a size medium. I look ridiculous in this top and I'm not going to order a size large because it will be too long and too big after I finish nursing my baby."
2931,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,t-shirt is way too short if you are short this would probably would be ok but if you are average to tall forget it.
2932,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Inconsistent sizes The 1st pair I bought were mediums,  fit perfectly, and were long, I read the reviews for a long fit. I decided to buy a second pair because I liked them so much. These mediums were way too small. I had to give them away."
2933,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Proportionally sleeves are way to large! The sleeves were very large kinda like MC hammer pants were :)
2934,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Right size just don’t like an exposed back Didn’t like the spaghetti string back feel
2935,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"it is very pretty and a great dress for the summer It fits a little bit tighter for a bigger chested person. Otherwise, it is very pretty and a great dress for the summer."
2936,1,B09M6X79V9,0,You need to correct the sizing Items are way too small!
2937,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"What Has Russell Athletic Done? I've always worn Medium, but this sweatshirt is too large and it doesn't resemble Russell sweatshirts that I've purchased in the past.  I've always been a fan of Russell Athletic gear, but I guess I'll have to shop elsewhere for sweatshirts in the future."
2938,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Ok Fits a little funny. Tapered bottom and sleeves fit weird; too tight than the rest of the shirt. Would not purchase again. Used for screen printing, ink soaked in funny.. bled."
2939,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Adorable but terrible quality. SUPER cute, particularly with a belt. My initial issue was that the top of the dress puckers a little around the armpit. It might be because I have a fairly large chest (34DD) or maybe it's just the sewing. But I figured for $20, I can deal. So I washed it, and got to work on the first day I wore it and noticed a big hole in the side on the seam! Ugh. Such a cute dress that I bought to help hide my early pregnancy and but it's too cheap to stand ONE wash, as per the instructions. You get what you pay for, I suppose."
2940,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Size up… The sweater fits weird. I’m a 5’4 145 pound woman and it fits kind of snug and this is a men’s jacket…I was disappointed tbh. Wish I would’ve bought from somewhere else. It’s just not flattering
2941,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Good Hoodie, had one just like it for years ...What Happened? Great Hoodie, had one just like it for years and wanted some new colors. Fits slightly baggy, but nothing to complain about. My first hoodie has shrunk a maybe an inch on the sleeves and a bit on the hood. If you don't want this to shrink just let it air dry or dry it on low.<br />For $15 it's a great deal.<br />UPDATE: I have washed this hoodie a few times and now it doesn't fit quite right. The hood has shrunk a bit, but only length wise, not width. I like to wear a hat under my hood which I've done for the past 5+ years with my previous hoodie and I've had no problems. The newer ones seem to have a slightly altered fit which also makes them bunch up around the pocket area. Normally I wouldn't care about these things, but having an older hoodie from the same company shows me they have changed in fit and quality a bit over the years. The old hoodie I have from them was made in Mexico and the new ones are made in Honduras...Not sure if that has something to do with it.<br />If you don't have an older hoodie from this company I doubt you'll care about the differences though. It is still good material and a decent fit for the price."
2942,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Eh not for me Not a fan but others might like them. They have a shiny spandex look which isnt the look I was going for. Didnt care for the drawstring waistband either.
2943,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I like the dress but.. I am 7 1/2 month pregnant, 5'2, and 154lbs. I ordered a small and I like the way the top of the dress looks and feels. My belly pushes the mid part of the dress out and it looks bigger than I would like. The material is nice and light. I'm happy I didn't go any bigger than a small. I may have been happier with a xs but the top of the dress might have been a little too snug."
2944,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Order a size up. Way too tight. I'm 6'1&#34; 175 lbs muscular build and the medium was too small.
2945,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"The color red... I order red, but it looks orange. It looks great though."
2946,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Nice fit & feel but unfortunately cheap quality - came damaged LOVED the fit and feel of this shirt.  However, it had a tear in the seam when it arrived and is Already unthreading even though I just got it out of the package less than 2 hours ago. :("
2947,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Not true to size Should have listened to reviews. I typically wear a medium or 8. This shirt runs very small. I would say if I bought this shirt in the store the medium would fit like an x-small or even small. I will re-order and size up either one size or two sizes up. I rarely take a large in anything much less an extra large however, with this shirt if you normally wear a medium then buy either large or better yet an extra large. Also, the material is polyester and spandex. I would not classify it as a compression shirt as advertised. The material is quite thin. Therefore, if you are wanting a shirt to ""hold you in"" this is not the shirt. I ordered red, black and white and like the colors."
2948,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Too low cut. Too low cut/rise to be comfortable. Was not included in description.
2949,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Fits a litter shorter than stated.
2950,2,B076QD9NP1,0,Two Stars bad quality
2951,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not for compression or working out! Super thin! These are not for shaping/compression  or working out in! It’s super thin material and you can see through. It reminds me of a thin sleep shirt which is what I’ll be using them for
2952,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Quality control? I was a bit disappointed; was wearing around house first time  and realized there was a 1 1/2 inch hole in the wrist seam. Since I had already removed all labels I mended myself. Now my husband is wondering if seconds are being sold???
2953,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Do not buy this dress you will be made I just got my dress in the mail today and it has holes in it already! Whoever made this did not know what they where doing at all!
2954,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,The sweater it self is great. The sleeve are made for children I am 5'7 130 lbs and fit. The sweater it self is great. The sleeve are made for children. WAY TOO TIGHT!
2955,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Not Soft If you are looking for softness keep looking. These are not fleece lined or anything. Not very soft.
2956,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Meh ! Meh !
2957,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Great for work for under scrubs! Great colors but fits a little snugger than expected.
2958,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,TOO LARGE Too Big. Just too big. Extremely disappointed. This is no good guys.
2959,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,same brand when shop but when delivered not same brand nit same fabric not same style i did purchased two different size with this seller or brand  small and medium but when received not same fabric  and the size medium is smaller /more tight than small size. its not the same. very disappointed .
2960,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Loved the leggings but had a hole in the side Really liked the leggings, wish they were a bit more compressing but they are very comfortable. I unfortunately had a small hole in mine."
2961,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"It has no give at all I didn’t look at the material so my error there , there is no stretch at all. Very tight through the bust. I think if it had some give and not poke a dots it may have worked. Was hoping it would for my daughter bridal shower. Have to send back"
2962,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,They can't get the sizing right The sizing on this product was ridiculous.  I am not sure if they used the same measurements as the other companies to define small medium and large.  Usually a large is a bit tight on me.  Each shoulder had at least a spare two inches and the chest had an extra five.  I was swimming in it.
2963,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Too small Looks nice but fits smaller than expected on a stocky body type
2964,1,B097RFTKJP,0,cheap The photo of this dress makes it look a little bit dressy. I was disappointed when i got it out of the package and saw the material it is made with. It does look like Halloween costume material. It was too loose up top and fit rather snug on the rest of my body. I will return for a refund.
2965,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Sizing is wayyy off I order two smalls of this product and had to return because it was too small. So I went with a medium and they are too big. I’m 5’5 and about 130lbs. They are good quality but it seems like their sizing is way off.
2966,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Very thin I sized you based on reviews. And could have went up another one too. They roll of to tight. And are basically see through. Not great. I’m normally an XL. I got a 2x
2967,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Sizing ran larger than chart indicated! Was a little to large, although size chart indicated they would fit right. Also a little cheaper material than the Teslo brand I usually purchase."
2968,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Already returned this item. They were all returned at the same time Too short. I returned this pair of pants along with the others<br />Why are you telling me to return this pair?<br />They were returned at the same time.
2969,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Way to small.. I ordered a 3x, it fits like an XL. I gave them to my niece instead of the hassle of shipping them back."
2970,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Three Stars Order larger size and still too small.
2971,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No thanks. Too small. Too short. I’m 5’7” at 170lbs. The large I bought felt more like a small.
2972,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Really small Sizing is way off, ordered 2 sizes larger than normal and wish I’d ordered 3 sizes larger. Not sure if they’ve changed as some reviewers said true to size!<br /><br />I’m keeping as I planned as an underscrub and very affordable for this. But I was thinking I may wear them at times by themselves and they will not be good for that at all."
2973,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not true size Not true size i order xl they look like M
2974,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Length Not long enough
2975,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not good quality Disappointed
2976,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,terrible It look totally different that the photos!!<br />i was trying to reach someone to get a refund because that’s not what i payed for!!
2977,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression Nice workout shirts, but they are NOT compression"
2978,2,B009R09Z8W,0,"Disappointed. Wore for two weeks and yesterday as I ... Disappointed.  Wore for two weeks and yesterday as I was pulling it off, the seams of the hood ripped on both sides of collar.  Funny part, I had already ordered a second one cause I did like it.  Good fit and feel, but maybe it's just a countdown till that one tears apart too.."
2979,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Seams I ordered these a size larger than my normal size because I wanted to wear them as pjs, after the second time wearing them the seam started to come apart. Wonderful pants but not sure about the quality. I don’t have a big butt by any means and a size larger than my Normal size, that shouldn’t happen. Disappointed."
2980,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Sizing off I have these in Large and XL. On the large the waistband is really tight so i bought an XL, which fits better in waist but the rest is too big, the XL is also shorter. Do not like the second pair i bought."
2981,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Three Stars Color is different than expected
2982,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars nothing to add
2983,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Really comfortable but started pilling after a couple of washes They were perfect at first but after 2 washes they began to pill and get scratchy. They are still wearable but not nearly as comfortable or attractive as they were at first. They are comfortable still but certainly look a bit rougher. With that being said, it didn’t stop me from buying another pair."
2984,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Maryjane Dress., I Guess.Well, it was delivered in a baggie It literally reeks to it's core fiber of marijuana.<br />The smell was so pungent that my search and recove dog zoned in on the scent.<br />Does everyone's purchase come with a free try it get high!? This is ridiculous. Does the seller even care products are being delivered in this manner?!"
2985,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Too Big! I ordered a medium but when it came in it is way too big to fit. Fits like a large. Disappointed after waiting so long for the product it didn't work out the way I thought it would.
2986,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"It doesn't look like the dress on post! I hate it!!!t I hated the material, it was suppose to be a sweater dress, not spandex! I was going to wear it to a funeral! Not appropriate for that!!"
2987,2,B009R09Z8W,0,"Changed the make I bought one of these about five years ago or so, and loved it. Thick, soft, and the perfect oversize. I finally wore it to the bone and wanted to get a new one that was more acceptable to wear outside the home. Not sure if I wanted an even more oversize or not, I ordered both a size 4x and 5x.<br />First of all. The 4x and the 5x are exactly the same size. I’d actually go so far as to say the 4x is slightly more comfortable for bigger people as the waistband isn’t as tight. Barring that, they’re the same size.<br />Secondly, the quality of the sweaters is completely different. I saw people mentioning that the quality shifts between the 4 and the 5, another reason for me ordering bc both sizes, but to me they were the same thin, cheap, scratchy material. Miles off from the great sweater I bought years ago. I’m unfortunately keeping one regardless (the 4X because, as mentioned, the bottom band is not as tapered and is more comfortable) but if I were more inclined, I would definitely look elsewhere. Very disappointed that one of the good options for plus sized sweaters sold out."
2988,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Very bad quality !!!!!! I am very disappointed with my purchase :-(
2989,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Too tight! Way too small and uncomfortable arm seams.
2990,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Comfortable Not what I was looking for. No real compression but comfortable. Returned
2991,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Zero compression The  tank tops are cute and comfortable But they offer zero compression if you are looking for a regular tank top then go for these but don’t expect any compression whatsoever
2992,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Cute but low cut They were so soft and cute. I'm giving a 3 star because at 5'8 and 140 lbs they are too low cut for this mom. I didn't want to squat it bend over and have my underwear keep showing.
2993,2,B009R09Z8W,0,"On the shorter side. I had bought a (4XL) hoodie in the olive green color which fit perfectly. However, when I bought the ash colored hoodie (same size) it came out a shorter than the olive one, which is a big let down."
2994,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Too tight Going to get the next size up and hope this fits bettet
2995,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,One Star Received damaged - badly sewn garment. Size Large probably for boys not mens. Buyer beware.
2996,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,I was looking for a certain color but read below 1st of all I NEVER wear Russell anything I still haven’t touched this!! I was looking for DRAK POWDER BLUE HOODIE (yet this came up so I figured try it)!! Not only did it take a mth almost to get here Bc supposedly got lost when then i put in for refund and magically it got found!! But wrong color runs big…. Just anything that could’ve went wrong with this it did!!!
2997,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"CUTE, BUT NEED A LITTLE WORK I really wanted to love this dress but it was not as well made as I expected. Not as flowy as I expected (models are deceiving) and the seam was off centered making the dress fit poorly. I did love the material as it was light weight, making it a perfect summer time dress."
2998,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Pretty but not best material This is a beautiful dress but very curve hugging and the material is stretchy but fades if it’s stretched even the slightest. I have a DD chest and it’s a good thing the top part is mostly the light colored pattern. I’m 5’4” and about 158 and the medium fits well.
2999,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Way to big
3000,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Eh Not long enough but soft material
3001,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not a true compression tank This is listed as a compression tank it is not a compression tank it does fit ok.  it’s loose I bought these to sleep in for extra support I have other tanks that fit tighter ok quality just not compression
3002,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Disappointed These fit right everywhere but the waist and they’re so cute it’s very disappointing :( for reference I am 5’2 and 105lbs. I ordered the XS. Will be returning
3003,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"I’m missing a pocket Like the right side .. there just isn’t a pocket… there is fabric sewn for a pocket, and stitching where the pocket should be.. but no pocket"
3004,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Eh These are okay for the price. There is nothing compression or athletic about them except maybe the fact that they’re a racerback cut.
3005,3,B09M6X79V9,0,NOT compression shirts!! These are not compression shirts.  Nothing about them compress lol purchased a size smaller like some of the other reviewers suggested and still not enough to “compress”.  Keeping them because they’re cheap and I can use them under my jackets but I would not purchase these again.
3006,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Terrible product. Waste of money This is a terrible buy. A scam. There is simply no compression at all. Fabric is extremely thin and stretchy . I wish it was possible to give Zero stars.
3007,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Weird design Dislike design
3008,1,B09M6X79V9,0,dont like them at all They run very short !!<br />And ride up on you.dont like them at all!!
3009,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Runs small Cute dress but it’s a fitted style. I would definitely size up.  I ordered my normal size and it was way too small.
3010,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Cheap Material Very cheap quality. Had returned.
3011,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ok I'm 6ft 1 and I wish they were longer
3012,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Arms too big Nice shirt but the arms are way too big.
3013,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Shirts are not compression. They do fit skin tight ... Shirts are not compression. They do fit skin tight but no compression. I'm comparing to Tommie Copper compression shirts.
3014,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Disappointed I didn’t wear it for a workout it was way to large for me! I’m sure someone will get good use out of them. I will be donating them
3015,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"The straps aren't that strong The strap on this dress broke the first time I wore it. I have rather big boobs, so I'll give you a pass."
3016,3,B09M6X79V9,0,They roll up The shirts roll up under my overalls.
3017,1,B097RFTKJP,0,not happy fits too small
3018,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"This jacket sucks! I ordered a regular size medium and it ... This jacket sucks! I ordered a regular size medium and it was to large for me.  This jacket also makes me sweat easier,  I also washed it once and the color started fading.  I want  a refund!"
3019,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Cheap and poor quality Super cheap material. Kind of a mesh feel to it... the quality is definitely below average. I would not recommend if you want a quality tank, and I will not be purchasing again."
3020,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression Not compression at all. Loose fitting, silky textured material. I still use them to work out but if you're looking for something compression wise- buy something else. Bought a medium but could've bought a small."
3021,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Not what I expected Love the dress not the material.  I was thinking it was cotton but it was polyester blend.  Not good for summer.
3022,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star I don't like this because is too large for me
3023,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Fit These run very small, two sizes two small. This is my reason for a bad review."
3024,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Small They run very small
3025,3,B0B16Q1854,0,They sewed in wrong size tags on the sweatpants! [[VIDEOID:e97980e8a6161f36c16336e69c84af27]] Video speaks for itself! Clearly both say medium on the tags and clearly they are not the same size! They sewed in the wrong tags in their sweatpants. No one knows any of the real sizes where you're buying these from! 😏🤪😂👎
3026,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Puckered seams The shirts have diagonal seams across the body as part of the design but the fabric puckered at the seams, looking cheap."
3027,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Hold off Cute dress and cut but you can see through it especially up top! Don't buy unless you like to wear scarves!
3028,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Defective Sweatshirt The sweatshirt has a ""run"" on the right side from the shoulder to the waist.  It appears as though a piece of string was pulled and left a line in the shirt that is quite obvious.  Unfortunate...."
3029,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Money wasted Horrible product.  Ordered extra small and there was absolutely no support or control.
3030,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,Size down Definitely not joggers they are leggings and I got a size small they are big in my crotch and the backs of my knees it’s very uncomfortable with extra fabric there I’m 17 5’5 and 150 Ib
3031,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,True color Color says arctic blue picture shows a light blue.  I received a grey dark bluish color.  Not what I wanted.  But I have a couple of these sweatshirts and I do like them.
3032,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not advertised color Not color exoected...not hot pink at all disappointed
3033,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Waist was good but Too short I’m 5’9” and these came right to the top of my ankles. After being washed they came about an 2 inches above.
3034,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Disappointed Doesn’t really look like the shirt in the picture. Don’t like it. Wasn’t happy.
3035,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not the same pink in the picture It's comfy like most sweatshirts but it is not the same pink that is shown.
3036,2,B0928FSGGD,0,tight I am 135 pounds I bought extra large super tight
3037,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Get your sizes right Bought a size smaller and its way to big
3038,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,OK but not a lot of compression These are OK and the best of this brand. However the band it weird as it is compressing butt he legging itself isn't. I'm a size 4-6 and this makes me look like I have a huge stomach. It constricts in the band and sort of squishes the tummy area down. If you have any belly on you these aren't flattering at all and make you look heavier.
3039,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Not compression fit as hoped for Bought these for my 14 year old daughter and they didn’t fit as we hoped.  Sleeves and body were baggy.  Returned.  Good quality product.
3040,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Not very happy I was looking forward to some comfortable sweats to wear when I got home from work.  Then I get them and put them on.  They fit fine but was super upset when I see this huge hole in the leg. Ugh.  So Mad.
3041,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Color loos faded The black on the fabric looks faded (like washed many times). I did not like that. It is sad because everything else is fine. I use it to be at home.
3042,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"It doesnt look as pictured Of course it has the same style (sort of) as pictured but the color of the one pictured is much darker than the one you receive. Fits just like my other crewnecks but not a fan of how light it is compared to the one pictured. Go to the store and find one that looks better than this one, waste of 20 dollars."
3043,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Too much stretch Very stretchy.  Not much compression. I wear under shirts or athletic style undershirts under workshirts. These do not cover my chest adequately.  Lots of side cleveage. Arm holes are way to big.  Granted, I'm the only one who knows about it. But still not what I was hoping for.  Will not buy again."
3044,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Good fit except… Quality is fine. The neck opening is too large and makes for awkward fit.
3045,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,One Star Not a good design...put together very poorly.
3046,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Too small Recommended size was too small
3047,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,Ink blue actually purple Very disappointed. I ordered a black pair and absolutely loved them so I ordered the ink blue and  was looking forward to get them. When they got delivered they actually were purple. I really loved the blue color that was listed but instead got purple. Very unhappy wish it was blue 😭
3048,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars just what i expected
3049,1,B0B16Q1854,0,WAY TOO SMALL I bought an XL and I’m not exaggerating when I say they were labeled XL but we’re truly sized XS. No exaggeration. I had to give them away.
3050,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Poor quality The dress is beautiful but after wearing twice (not even washing it), the fabric looked like if I had had it for years. I had to thow it away. Too bad, the fit was great and the design beautiful!"
3051,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not my perfect fit. I like the feel and it does have good fit over all. I was looking for more length, keeps riding up would not purchase again."
3052,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Order two sizes bigger!! Made way toooooo small buy two sizes bigger
3053,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Fit as expected. First wash, and the color fade away. Now the black is gray."
3054,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Sizing is off Not near the size it said it was.  It says it runs a little small.  I wear an xlg so I ordered a 3xlg and couldn’t get it over my head.  That isn’t running a little small!
3055,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Look some more Run a little big. They sent out last minute could reach customer service. It’s like spandex material, so over priced. Not happy how long it took. Waste of money in my eyes."
3056,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,if description matches the product ... This compression shirt has 0% compression. It is just like a regular under shirt with 3 times more expensive. I tried and return right away.<br />Extremely disappointed. There is no compression at all. I don't know how this once gets such a high review. I followed the size chart<br />and ordered. Also this tanks are little short... not too short but look short and I ordered the XL size. I would not recommend these to anyone<br />who wants to use as a compression shirt.
3057,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars size is off
3058,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not a win Itchy fabric with lingering odd smell even after washing.
3059,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Cheap material NOT worth the cost at all! Very cheap and stretchy material.  Design is printed faded and very static fabric,  sticks on you and moves around."
3060,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Poor quality I wore this shirt once, washed it, and it fell apart. Now to try and figure out how to get it replaced...."
3061,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Comfy and fun but I'm 5'8 and it did not fit as ... Comfy and fun but I'm 5'8 and it did not fit as a maxi, it is short and more for girls with a smaller chest. Having said that it is a fun comfy fit can wear with chucks and a jeans jacket or around the house and be fine with it."
3062,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Great legging but had a rip in it Fit on the tighter side for a medium, but as expected since I wanted the compression. Only thing is it came with a rip and I didn’t even get to use it yet."
3063,3,B009R09Z8W,0,I like the quality & look of this Tie Die but ... I like the quality & look of this Tie Die but it came too big & I will have to send it back & get a size that fits.
3064,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Sizes are very small I ordered an XL so I could be comfortable in them, but when I tried to put them on, they were the size of a small! Maybe they were mislabeled when they were made? I had to give them to my child."
3065,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"Cute Dress! The dress looks as pictured. My daughter is pretty skinny, usually wears a 7/8 and I ordered a size up as suggested. The arm pit area is very large and the chest across is quite wide. Otherwise it is adorable!"
3066,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"ordered 3X to be safe and it's like a large size guide way off, ordered 3X to be safe and it's like a large. So disappointing, love the dress and couldn't even were it"
3067,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Sleeve width mismatch Decent material overall but the arms width is horrible. I have attached image comparing this hoodie(red) with a champion pullover of same 2xl sizes. The red one can hold two limbs in one arm sleeve. Very disappointed by the lapse in quality control. Do not buy this product.
3068,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Disappointed I thought these would be perfect for traveling up north, but I was dissatisfied with the overall fit. They were super long (5’6) and the waist area I felt was very awkward. The back was low rise and the front was more of a high rise. So the inseam looked very weird and uncomfortable. Will be returning."

3072,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not a compression shirt of any kind This is not a compression shirt, at all. Even if the product had fit appropriately (it was probably a size too large), it's rather flimsy so it wouldn't have provided any kind of compression. It's essentially just an athletic tank top, nothing more. It is comfortable, at least, but if you're looking for a tank top that provides any compression this isn't it. Fit wise I'm 5'6"" 135lb, a small was too large for me. Not even snug at all."
3073,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"Joe's, you let me down! I got a 4x tall a while ago and I love it. It is actually soft, cozy, and true to size. I needed another hoodie so naturally I purchased this one. I needed a 5x regular though and just figured it would be the same material. I was WRONG! This thing is garbage! I didn't return it because my son who is much smaller than I am wanted a thin crappy hoodie he could wear to the gym. So, it worked out but for the wrong reason. This thing is thin and tiny. So, if you know someone who wants a hoodie they can trash at the gym, this is perfect. If you want a functional hoodie that's comfortable and fits like it should, look elsewhere. I tried to contact the seller to find out why their tall hoodies are so different from their regular ones. It directed me to Amazon customer service. Since it's not Amazon's fault, I thought I'd leave a review instead so others don't make the same mistake I did."

Extremely poor quality. The little silver circle that is on the pants for the string ties, came off. Didn't get to wear them because it immediately came off. Cute pants but quality is very poor."

Sadly, after the first cold wash  it now looks like I've washed it 12 plus times in hot water.  My daughter loves it too much as its soft and she’s autistic so i get to keep it.

I was hoping they would be a dupe but you get what you pay for. These also give you a camel toe because of how thin the fabric is in the crotch area."
3104,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Terrible fabric After wearing in the sun and washing 1 time, (cold water hang dry) the fabric faded and the dress looked a year old. Sad because it’s a very cute dress and a great fit. I got soo many compliments.  Wish the fabric was a polyester that would last for years. Instead I got to wear it out once. :("

I used to but Russell Premium Fleece sweatshirts and they never did this. Of course the were 80 cotton and 20 poly. Why they would cheapen there brand with this garbage is beyond me. The sweatshirts I bought look so bad now that I would not wear them. Not worth the money at all. What a shame.

These aren't compression shirts, they don't hold your stomach in at all and I ordered a Medium and am 6'5"" tall so two sizes smaller.  They're still great shirts for the price to wear under a tee to keep from sweating through or for the gym.  Just don't order them if your goal is to give a slimming effect because that's not something they do."

Giving it three stars because they described it to be very heavy thread weight. Well, its not, its your normal run of the mill sweater, but for $20 maybe it will do for a NE fall.

Really just tight tank tops I have had compression socks before, and I get the premise, but the fabric doesn't really compress other then the fact that they feel like they are a size too small, and look like it too.

3179,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Ok but ran large Ok but does not provide it much compression support.  Also runs larger than I expected so given some of the comments about running small etc seems to have a lot of variability in size

3181,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not a compression top I do like the tank tops but I was expecting it to be a compression fitting top and it's not. They are just stretchy. I would purchase them again but not as a compression top. I think it's misleading to call them compression tank tops.

I ordered these in XL hoping to get them a little looser for comfort to keep me warm this winter. Even though each of the 3 tops had an XL tag, the sleeve sizes are 3 different lengths ranging from just to my wrists to about 2 inches too short! Even being XL they fit like a medium top typically would and are way too tight in the arms for comfort. It's a shame as the fabric feels really soft at least. Also be aware the Pink Heather doesn't look at all like the picture, it's an extremely bright neon pink. Overall really disappointed with this purchase, waste of money."

3194,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Mediocre, but nice style. These tank tops are perfect to wear under a dressy shirt and they're also good for working out or casual wear. However, the material tends to crawl up and curl up if you're wearing your exact size. I ordered smalls since I'm built small, and in the middle of the evening, it rode up my stomach. They are super comfy and perfect fit, but depending on how you sit or what you wear over them, they have a tendency to shift around."

While our local Walmart and K-Mart had them of lesser quality, but lower priced, I didn't want to bother with packaging and mailing it myself, so I ordered through Amazon. Unfortunately, it was a third party sale, so no free shipping. It was nice enough, according to my son. I just had him home for Thanksgiving and was disappointed to find that the left front pocket is already ripping open at the top.  I didn't have time to sew it during this trip, and hope it doesn't worsen before he comes home for Christmas.  He's only had this hoodie for about two months now.  That part was disappointing. I think I would rather take my chances at the local Walmart or K-Mart next time he needs a hoodie. No shipping, and I could easily return a faulty item."
3198,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star Very small and thin.... Does not fit accounting to size.
3199,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star fits short dont buy if tall
3200,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Sweaty Sweatbox - Does Not Breathe These sweatshirts look nice, but I should have known that a blend of 50% polyester and 50% cotton would not breathe properly. I fell for Russell's mumbo-jumbo about this sweatshirt being a product of hi-tech. Baloney! These sweatshirts make you sweat uncomfortably. The fabric does not breathe. I will be looking for a 100% cotton sweatshirt."
3201,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not well made Dissatisfied with qualify, not like the old stuff"
3202,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Great Great but slow shipping
3203,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Trash I would give this product 0 stars if I could.  It's nothing like it's picture.It's super short and made of cheap material. It went right into the trash can.
3204,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Compression tanks Cheap material and doesn’t hold!  Definitely not compression! Very disappointed!
3205,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Two Stars Doesn't work for someone with bigger assets up top. Way too tight.
3206,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Pésima calidad Solo una lavada y lleno de motas quedó, terrible"
3207,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,too narrow at the waist very narrow at the waist so muffin-top is guaranteed unless you get 1-2 sizes bigger but then the hips will be too big.  i wear a size 6 and don’t have a thick waist so this doesn’t usually happen. i bought a medium and the hips would fit but the waist was like a size 2
3208,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Made very small Tag says 3XL more like a Medium
3209,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"good for a beach coverup. it was showing a lot of skin on the sides under the arm. it was flattering, but I ended up sending it back because I wasn't comfortable with the amount of skin showing. good for a beach coverup."
3210,1,B09M6X79V9,0,I guess I should cut it off and stitch it down.... Attention to detail is very important.
3211,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"One star Way too large, and after one use the front pocket has begun to tear at the corner"
3212,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Itchy tag, bad for tall guys These fit pretty bad to be honest. I'm 5'9, i got a small and it's it short and rides up in the middle of working out, and what's worse is the tag in the back, it's so itchy and uncomfortable so i tried to pull it off and i ripped a shirt, i tried to cut the tag off the other two and they're still itchy and uncomfortable, i just don't understand why they would put the tag there when other similar shirts have it in the bottom or they have none at all, I don't recommend these."
3213,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Regrets Not what I expected.
3214,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not satisfied This isn’t what I expected at all, I wanted shirts to help shape. These are nothing special, basic under tees and no compression at all."
3215,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Flimsy material Very cheap material and flimsy.  Very sheer and lightweight.  Piece of junk.
3216,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Wouldn't order again Very dissatisfied. I purchased for compression and doesn't have much of any.
3217,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Fitted, not compression Even using the sizing chart & buying a size smaller than I normally would, these are not compression tanks. They are fitted, which is different (and perfectly good if that’s what you’re looking for). If you need actual compression for any reason (such as help with nerve pain while working out), look elsewhere."
3218,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Very small I ordered two sizes to big and it still is too small The colors
3219,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Check it! The seam is on the front of the dress…who does that? So frustrating. It’s backwards. 🙄
3220,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Definitely no compression lolol These should not be labeled as &#34;compression&#34; lolol.  There is NO compression going on here.  I'm sure they are fine for daily wear otherwise, but I was hoping for compression tops to wear over my workout bra.  I even bought them 2 sizes smaller in hopes it would be snug.  Nope.  They are just tank tops. I am returning them."
3221,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Didn't like crew neck. I didn't expect the crew neck from the photo.  It's very restrictive.
3222,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Size is weird I was wanting a compression tank.  I am an 8-10.  The small was way too tight and the Med. was way too big!
3223,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not for working out I go to a spin class and these tops roll up as I’m riding. I have to constantly pull the top down to keep it from rolling up to my chest exposing my stomach. I purchase a size up to avoid this from happening but nope. Maybe I should have gone 2 sizes up.
3224,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Fine Fine
3225,1,B07XD71F1H,0,the material was awful a thought the 2 dresses would be nice. . but will never buy again.
3226,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Runs small The quality is great, but I ordered according to the measurements and it was too small/right. Ended up giving them to my teen daughter who loves them. They look great on her"
3227,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Runs big This dress made me look like a house! Maybe it’s not the dress for my body type but it was not flattering at all. I can usually wear a L/XL in dresses but this one was too big and I don’t think sizing down would have made it look better on me
3228,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars I find the jacket small compared to others from the Russell brand.
3229,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"I do like the tops Go up at least one size. I'm a 4/6 or medium top but wear a snug large in this shirt. I  do like the tops, though."
3230,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Size Down I read all the reviews before purchasing. I came to the conclusion that I should buy a large. Big mistake! They fit me like a regular tank top. Did not do anything for me. I should have bought a medium. My sister who is about 20 lbs heavier then me however benefit from them so I let her have them. I however will not buy them again. I’m 5’ 7” and 166 lbs.
3231,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Great tanks for workout but not compression I’m giving these tank tops 3 stars because they do fit as expected however, I specifically ordered them because they were described as “compression” tank tops. They are not compression tanks at all. They are simply a thin poly/spandex blend. They are still great for working out but not exactly the type I was looking for."
3232,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,First set was awesome. Second set was too stretchy and did nothing ... Completely different shirt the second time I ordered it. First set was awesome. Second set was too stretchy and did nothing for me.
3233,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not Compression These are nice dry fit tank tops but they are not a compression fit or cut. I bought XS and am usually an XS to a S in size…and currently on the larger end of that spectrum. These are definitely not compression
3234,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars They are like regular gym tops.  No compression whatsoever.
3235,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Love but funny fit I really wanted to love this but the fit was weird. It was short in the back and the sleeves were too wide for my liking. I love the color scheme but ended up returning.
3236,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Three Stars Love it
3237,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Just your basic tank Stretchy basic tank.
3238,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Nope! Returned and never reordered and will NOT!
3239,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not great, feels low-quality Do not by if you are at all a slim individual. Hoodie bunches up a massive amount in the front."
3240,1,B0B16Q1854,0,I would never buy these again. How embarrassing it was to walk out in public with these One leg is taller then the other and the pocket was closed
3241,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Good enough My favorite sweatshirt is a many, many years old Russell Dri Fit.  It's ragged and stained but is the most comfortable one in my sweatshirt arsenal.  Really good weight and just oversized enough to look as comfortable as it feels.  So when I decided to add to my drawer I immediately looked and found the faithful Russell Dri Fit.<br /><br />I hate to say its not what my old one is.  Its comfortable enough... its over sized enough... the weight is almost as comfortably as heavy as my original; but not quite.  Its just good enough.<br /><br />I'll wear it in rotation buy it will never take on the battle scars of my original.  I have a feeling it won't last near as long."
3242,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Quality not so great Ripped a week after I bought it
3243,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not worth it Not compression. At. All. This feels likes swim suit material without any lining. I’m bummed I missed the “return window” and am now stuck with them. P
3244,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Little small Goes up too far in the back I feel
3245,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Big Seam Down Front - Pattern Not Matched! Unlike many of the review photos, the dress I received had a big unmatched seam right up the FRONT of the dress. Very noticeable and unattractive. Overall not great quality on fabric or sewing."
3246,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Two Stars Way way too big
3247,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"not comfortable dont like the style, not like the picture"
3248,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"A little large A little too big, I should have sized down"
3249,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Two Stars Very thin fabric.
3250,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Stinky shirts The shirts Have a good quality fit good I really like the shirts but I do have an issue the ones I received were really stinky like armpits so somebody worn them before I got them
3251,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Sizing is way too small. Way too small and not as described.  I ordered a 5x and it fits my size 8 daughter and not me.
3252,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Not a long tank top at all
3253,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Eh. They’re shiny… tight stretchy… weird pockets. Not my favorite, unfortunately….<br />And they’re thinner."
3254,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Ok Ok product
3255,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,No refund! No exchange ! Didn't fit and could not return.  Disappointed.
3256,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Full Zip Fleece Hoodie I got 2 different sizes from Prime Wardrobe to see which one would fit better.  The smaller one was too small and the larger one was way too big.  No luck with this brand anymore.  Had to return both.
3257,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,". after two wears, signs of wear began to appear. looks terrible The product arrived and looks great. However, after two wears, signs of wear began to appear, which I did not expect so early. The collar looks terrible and you can't use the product beyond sleeping at home. It's a shame that it is no longer possible to return it"
3258,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Extremely low waist, not for me I read several reviews because I was questioning the size. No one mentioned that the waist sits extremely low. And I mean low. It barely covered my butt cheeks and couldn’t sit down.  Total disaster and disappointment. Returned"
3259,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,not good way too big
3260,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"if you want compression order smaller!!!! i am normally a large in shirts, occasionally a medium. i read other reviewers that fit this profile suggesting a size small for compression. the small was great, the medium would have looked like a normal tank, the large would have hung off of me."
3261,1,B09M6X79V9,0,THESE ARE NOT COMPRESSION TANKS These definitely are NOT compression tank tops as it says . Just very thin light weight tank tops . Would not have purchased if they weren't falsely represented in the description.
3262,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Was nothing close to the image Looked nothing like the image
3263,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star horrible fit
3264,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Poor quality all the way around Was tight in the forearms, baggy on my biceps and the folds of the front lay all different directions. Washing and ironing did not help w/ the fabric lying properly. Poor quality all the way around."
3265,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Dissatisfied Was very dissapointed the white shirt was yellow discolored where the cardboard was under it. Unable to get the discolor out!!
3266,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Too small Too small
3267,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star This hoodie has a bad stitching. The zipper at the abdomen comes out as if someone has pot belly.
3268,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Review. Not that firm of material.
3269,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Too Small! This was exactly what I was looking for, but I was hoping for a looser fit, so I ordered a size medium. The medium is still too small and now I wish I ordered a large or a different item altogether. I just don't want farmer's tan while jogging anymore :/"
3270,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Absolutely no compression. I got my size and even ... Absolutely no compression.  I got my size and even though it's big on me I don't think getting a smaller size would make it any less a standard tank top.
3271,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,I normally wear a large so I was hoping this would fit more like medium. Should have just got a medium I ordered a large because of the reviews saying items fit small. I normally wear a large so I was hoping this would fit more like medium. Should have just got a medium. Hopefully it will tighten up after I was it. Super cute cardigan!
3272,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not true to size, too small, too short. This tank top is not true to size. It is extremely short as well. I am 5'5"" and generally wear a size L. I ordered a L and it fit like a small. I gave them to my 12 year old daughter to try who is 5'1"" and generally wears a ladies small and they were too small on her as well."
3273,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Okay... For the price, it wasn't awful. But I thought the material was super thin and the size was a bit small. I'm 5'4&#34; and 140 lbs... buy the medium if you want extra space. Small is fine if you don't mind fitted."
3274,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Do not recommend Too small and too short for a medium I’m normally a small but bc of the material I bought what I thought was a size up ... it fits like a extra small and short at that my belly almost shows
3275,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Seams are coming apart I’ve only had this sweatshirt a month and the seams in the front pocket are all coming apart. So disappointing.
3276,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Pilling, Cheap Materials I expected these to be fairly nice considering the price but they were pilling straight out of the package. I’ve washed them once and they look like pants I’ve owned for years. They are comfortable and the string is more of a small rope. They don’t feel like they’ll hold up for long. I would look elsewhere."
3277,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Three Stars Material is cheap, but price is good"
3278,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Should fit hope Good so farpo
3279,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Fits Well and Comfortable, but with Regular use zipper broke after 4 months.mm After just 4 months of moderate use, the zipper broke, poor quality."
3280,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not good material. The material is super thin, you can see if circle of your belly button with the shirt on. Not a fan at all."
3281,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Disappointed. After reading a bunch of the reviews I was convinced that these were going to be amazing for working out. Well, that could not be further from the truth. Besides being extremely uncomfortable, they are also see through. These feel like something I could pick up the dollar tree, not something worth $25. Will be returning."
3282,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Way too big?? Wth? Not a small!!? More like a XXL
3283,1,B0B16Q1854,0,I think the pants are small in size. Need a larger size.
3284,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not fleece I wanted a fleece sweatshirt for my dad and this is just a plain cotton sweatshirt. Not sure what they think fleece is but I can assure you it’s not this. Very disappointed.
3285,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Not worth it I'm sending it back for credit. The fabric felt cheap and the it's short and wide cut.
3286,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Read the reviews ...way too small Decent material but these were way too small. I ordered an extra large, but these could actually fit my son who is 10 years old and wearing size 12/14. The tags said XL but these shirts were definitely missed tagged."
3287,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star I WANT A REFUND
3288,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Too tight in bust Very tight in the bust area and very loose everywhere else
3289,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"This dark blue/polka dot dress was nothing like the photo This dark blue/polka dot dress was nothing like the photo. The material is thin, slightly shiny, polyester. The hemline is shorter in the front (mid-shin) and long in back, and a seam runs down the front center of the dress. I thought it looked cheap and returned it."
3290,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Nice but see through Dress is very comfortable but very see through. It’s fine as a beach cover up but if you want to just wear it you will need a slip or something under it. I will probably just use over my swim suit or around the house.
3291,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Poor quality Third time I ordered this product and the quality gets worse with each other. The tanks are so thin and product very little compression. I ordered a small, and it still fits loose."
3292,2,B07XD71F1H,0,"Very long sleeves, Cheap fabic Extra long sleeves and thin t-shirt cotton. Will probably return. Looks much better online. Yuck."
3293,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Good fit, poor quality material Needed some basic tanks for the gym and figured I would give these a try. I really like my 90 degree compression tanks and was hoping these would be comparable, but they aren’t. These are soft and the fit is good, I like that they aren’t super long. The material is not compression, though. It actually feels similar to a bathing suit material."
3294,2,B07XD71F1H,0,"Don’t get it Dress is very clingy and tight and shows every flaw. Not flattering at all. Material is more spandex like then dressy. Doesn’t flow and the neckline makes you look fat. Unless your a size 2 and no fat rolls, this is not the dress you should get. Looks nothing on like it does on the perfect model"
3295,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Cheap look and feel Thought this was solid but it was mesh. Must have overlooked that part. I ordered an XL and it was too loose in the waist and to long for my liking. Will seek elsewhere. It also looks and feels cheap.
3296,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,They sent the wrong size 4 times I like the shirts. They are quality and great for the gym but when I tried to order more I ordered an XL but they send XXL. I return the XXL with a specific note that the item is the wrong size and I would like them to ship me a size XL in exchange.... Well guess what... They sent me another XXL and this happened 4 different times. I really wanted the shirts is why I went through all of this but even after attempting this a 4th time the still sent XXL.<br /><br />Very disappointing and very poor customer service.
3297,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression, but still alright.... 3 stars only because these are advertised as 'compression' tanks, but they definitely are not. They are form fitting,  but that's about it. They're nice material,  cool, lightweight. Pretty true to size."
3298,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Great value for the price, but they pill really quickly. I have had these for less than a week, and worn them to work from home for 3 of those days.  They are extremely comfortable and fit well.  Unfortunately, they have already started to pill on the butt area.  It's not a big enough problem to prevent me from maybe ordering a second pair, but they are certainly only for wearing at home if the bottom looks that way so quickly."
3299,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not all the same size. Received two different sizes in the package need to arrange for return
3300,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not enough compression Avatar the product across it didn’t have enough compression.
3301,1,B07XD71F1H,0,I don’t like it the material very cheap This product looks very different in picture than the real ..the price so expensive comparing by material
3302,1,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Not for me Usually do not like to leave negative reviews. Very large. Full size. Not fitted.
3303,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Okay Sleeves were too long. Send product back
3304,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Somewhat small
3305,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Dont waste your money Rides up and turns into a belly shirt...very disappointed
3306,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not bad for the price Bought these for my husband and they are really nice tank tops but they’re see through which is the only downfall. They also are somewhat a shorter length
3307,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars ok but you pay for it
3308,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ok Ok
3309,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Not French Terry fabric! The pants are super thin and not fleece fabric as described. They are so thin you can feel the back side of the letters. Not soft at all.
3310,1,B0B16Q1854,0,To big The other 2 were perfect all 3 said large ..the black one is like XXL
3311,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Very large Sweatshirt A waste of money Size Chart is wrong. Ordered a size M. Very large Sweatshirt<br />A waste of money. Can not return because they are in Ukraine. Very disappointed with the purchase
3312,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Got a huge hole in the seam after first wash.
3313,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not a compression shirt, does not help with shaping I read many of the bad reviews and chose to give it a try anyway. Very disappointed. These are basically tight vests. They don't help with shaping."
3314,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Cute but small It’s a cute dress but it’s small then the size measurements say
3315,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"White shirt is longer than the black and grey Bought 3 xl tank tops but for some reason the white shirt was longer and a little bit wider. Im 6'4"" 230 so the white fits perfectly but the black and gray is a little too short."
3316,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Short in back Cute shirt, very soft.  Really thin so its not to keep warm.  But it is really short in the back and looks awkward so I am returning."
3317,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars has worn well
3318,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Very unhappy customer! Didn’t like the tanks and fit small, not true to size very disappointed!"
3319,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Decent/close to the pictured item Cute. Good for the price. Not as flowy as pictured
3320,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Arms are EXTREMELY WIDE the arms are like 2 feet wide at the shoulder. very strange and doesn't fit slim at all.
3321,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Perfect if you are built like a spaghetti noodle I'm not gonna lie to you guys. I bought a mens hoodie because I am always stealing mens hoodies from men and I tried to be responsible and just buy my own. It fits weird. Probably not weird if you're a tall skinny guy; Itd fit you perfectly. But it's very long. The bottom of the hoodie is tight and clings to you, so it looks weird if you're not pulling it down all the time. Which is a look you might want. But for me, I wasnt a fan.<br /><br />I don't know where you men buy your stealable hoodies. The search continues."
3322,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Did NOT work for me Too small and looks weird. I think it would look better on a very skinny person.
3323,3,B09M6X79V9,0,No thanks They looked great but they were way too small. The return process did not go well.
3324,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Super cute, but wayyyyyyy too small Super cute, but wayyyyyyy too small. I'm usually a small, but I ordered a medium.  Sadly it was very short and overall unflattering fit."
3325,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Two Stars Not happy with how it fits. Very weird fitting in the top .
3326,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Just lil small Gave it to the kids lil small on me
3327,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Small Runs very small. I realize they were meant to be snug but there's a difference between small and snug
3328,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Small fit Small fit - Not made for those with long arms . It wasn’t tight fitting either, more like loose and clingy"
3329,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,"no good This shirt might look good on the model when she is perfectly posing, but it runs large, the arm wholes are huge and is unflattering because it doesn't stay in place (want a boob hanging out an arm hole??). I will not be wearing this."
3330,1,B09M6X79V9,0,RUNS SUPER SMALL I ordered a L in U.S. and it fits like a s/m they run extremely small

The material is soft and spandex like, and my daughter likes twirling in it.<br /><br />Had I received the right dress - this was totally have been a great product for me."
3332,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Not as seen on picture I did not like the material; dress was too thin and not flattering at all!

3334,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Run small. Returning I am disappointed that these sweats don't fit me.  They are cut low in the back & smaller there.  Legs fit fine.  Soft and comfy materisl, just way too small."
3335,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"NOT A COMPRESSION TANK I ordered the correct size which fit perfectly EXCEPT THESE ARE IN NO WAY COMPRESSION AS ADVERTISED.<br />To even get a mild compression across the abdomen I had to gather and pin the back taking in at least 6"" of fabric. I am returning the tanktops for a refund. This is the product description: ""Compression Base Layer Dry Fit Tank Top"", which is why I ordered them to support my abdomen after surgery, so I call this blatant false advertising."
3336,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Just opened this. You have to wear the back ... Just opened this.  You have to wear the back in the front in order for it to fit.  It is made very poorly.  Definitely not a dress I would wear out of the house.
3337,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Lighter than pictured It’s a beautiful dress but fabric is lighter almost a blue and almost looks like it’s been washed and dried. I like it and I’m keeping it but just wasn’t what I expected.
3338,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Don’t love it It’s comfortable but rather clingy and too long.  It also looks rather worn after only wearing it 2x and hand washing it twice.
3339,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"There is NO stretch, just compression These are not made<br />Of true compression material, the kind that gives but still supports. I returned these and ordered a different brand."

3341,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Don’t do it Hated them.
3342,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Alright The design is good and they fit well but they keep super hot.  Will look for cotton next time.
3343,2,B09M6X79V9,0,No bra at all just a tight shirt that makes u look like u have no boobs I’m so upset with myself because of this purchase. Of course I was expecting a bra in them and absolutely none. I know I know I should have read the description. I never return anything so I’m stuck with them. Maybe my kiddo will want them when she gets older as these are junk to me also they are skin tight so buy a size up for sure
3344,2,B009R09Z8W,0,It was way to big in the chest and arms ... It was way to big in the chest and arms. The neck hole was small and I even ripped it putting it on within a week of owing it. The hood seems too small as well.
3345,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Worse fabric ever The worse material in the world. I wore it one time not even washed it but all fabric got fluffy and fade it.
3346,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Description not accurate. Runs small
3347,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Quality Way too small for an x large.  I wear women's m
3348,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Two Stars I tried similar sizes in store and this one runs about 1 or more size to small
3349,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Seam down the front of the dress ? Ok, I know clothes look different from what the model is wearing to what it looks like on me. I was hoping this item would look a little better. First, I'm kind of busty....40 DD. I thought from the other reviews that I read that the Large would fit. Unfortunately it didn't. Through the bust area was WAY too tight. Second, I can't quite figure out why the front of the garment has the seam from the &#34;V&#34; up top all the way to the bottom. Shouldn't that have been in the back? I did not care for that. It made me look like I was wearing it backwards. Third, the material is very flimsy. Poor quality fabric. So........I had to return it. The picture looks amazing, but in reality it looks cheap."
3350,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Three Stars Enhh..
3351,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Okay but not if you want to use it to workout The shirts stretch out after first wash. I thought them would stay compressed a bit longer.
3352,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Was too smalls To small got one same size that fits good i gave it away
3353,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small Runs small I wish they were longer as well

3355,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"5'5, 140LB, 36DD. Bought and returned I was looking for a compression/thermal to wear under my scrubs at work. The product is decent for the price, but just not what I had expected. Some of the reviews said that they were warm, fitted and like a real compression shirt. I'm 5'5, 140 pounds with a DD chest size. I ordered a small in these. I was expecting a very tight fit but to my surprise they were still baggy around my stomach area and the most important place for me, the sleeves. I did not want to be constantly rolling up the sleeves when I'm wearing gloves. The material was also just very thin, and I wished they were a little thicker and warmer. The shirts would be great for some who doesnt like skin tight though!"
3356,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"they fit small I like the color and the fabric, but they fit a bit too tight and I got a larger size than needed."
3357,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,the size.. The medium was too small and the large was too big (loose)
3358,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"I’m so sad I really wanted to like these. I bought the heather red/gray and black pack. First, they stunk. Like dirty sweat sock stink.( it wasn’t in the delivery cause I got another item in the same package and it didn’t smell like that) The red is lighter then the picture. Like an orangey pink. The arms are too short and the neckline is a little wide. To be fair, I usually wear a medium and They were sold out so I bought a large. So the arms should have been long enough.  On the upside, they fit in the body and were long enough at the waist."
3359,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Warm and cozy walking Fits perfect. Nice and warm for winter walking.
3360,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Cheap material The material is cheap and it ripped within a couple of wears.

3363,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Hoodwinked into this awful hoodie! Total Garbage....thinner than tissue paper...zipper made to break...bought to wear one on a trip and throw away, but it wasn't even good enough for that."
3364,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Total garbage Not what the picture looks like at all.
3365,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"These run quite small!  I wear M, but ordered L, I could have used an XL! Very disappointing. Like the look, fabric, etc, but they run small!  Would not purchase again..."
3366,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Too wide cut Sewn very well, about 2 - 3 sizes larger, and long sleeves on both size. Sewing quality is very good, the stuff is great."
3367,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Skip these, inconsistent sizing I got a three pack. All of the tanks were the same size, but one was quite a bit shorter than the other two to the point of being too small. They're fine tanks, but one just doesn't fit me. Sizing should be consistent at this price point."
3368,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star No shelf bra inside. Too loose.
3369,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"in the laundromat trying to shrink the sweater Got this sweater today and the damn thing is big its a good Quality sweater But it fits too big. Got it in large. If your a person who wears large and extra large, get it in Medium And save yourself some money on going to the laundromat and trying to shrink it -___-"

3375,1,B0928FSGGD,0,"stinky! these are unfortunately of that kind that starts stinking badly after the first wearing, and no washing can wash it out. this is a common issue with synthetic workout clothes, alas I have no idea how to know this in advance."
3376,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not recommended. Does not really keep your body warm the way I expected cool gear to do.
3377,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Wanted to love it Sigh,  I wanted to love this dress. It is pretty and it does fit nicely. However it feels so cheap and it's really thin.  For the price of it, I just assumed the material would be better."
3378,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Four Stars Fits good but even after washing has a odd smell<br />this shirt is starting to stink bad dont know why tired washing several times
3379,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Kmart quality After reading all the rave reviews I ordered a 3 pack of these yoga tops. The material is like something from a kmart discount rack. Not at all what I was expecting after reading about the superior quality. Don't waste your money.
3380,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"I ordered a medium & it was more like a small I ordered a medium & it was more like a small. Quality was good, but order larger size than you normally wear."

3382,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not squat proof They definitely make your butt look great however the material is not squat proof. Plus every little cellulite and dimple does show
3383,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Fabric was not good Would not order again
3384,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Too small This shirt does not fit as expected in correlation with the sizes.
3385,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Very Large Very large size. I'm 5'3"" and about 110#. Dress was more like a nightie"
3386,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Sizeup especially if you are busty.
3387,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Unpredictable sizing I have three of these sweatshirts and all three have different proportions depending on the color. This maroon one has sleeves too short and loose cuffs and waist.
3388,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Love these but don’t last long I love these sooo much, flattering and comfy for the gym. Def remind me of the gymshark look. However I’ve had these a little over a month now, worn only a few times and I have a hole already. I’m super sad about it. Old Navy leggings aren’t as flattering and compressive but are way cheaper and I have yet to get any holes."
3389,3,B09M6X79V9,0,tightly to the arm oumit All in all they are cute just too sngu in my chest aran m are & underarms
3390,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Size smaller then it’s discerption Have to order a size bigger
3391,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not compression shirts Elastic, sure. Form-fitting, definitely. Compression? No."
3392,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Mens I ordered a 2x for my husband and it was to big size down
3393,3,B076QD9NP1,0,"It looked like a baby doll cut My daughter had a cat dress that had this pattern 2 sizes ago.  When I ordered this dress according to the reviews and size guide, the dress was too small.  It fit (although tightly), but the seam between the skirt and shirt part was waay too high.  It looked like a baby doll cut.  But, because I knew she wanted to wear it, I went back and ordered a size up.  That one fits, but the arm holes are too loose.  She's 5 so of course that's fine, but that only gets 3 stars."
3394,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not at all as described! These are tank tops not compression tanks. They are baggy camisoles.
3395,2,B09M6X79V9,0,They ripped after 2 wears Ripped after 2wears seams under the arms
3396,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Two Stars Thought it would be more fitted
3397,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Deceiving material The material is like the red Pennys you used to get in gym class to divide the teams.
3398,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Cheap and Thin. Disappointed. Returned. Cheap and Thin. Disappointed. Returned.
3399,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Not true to size. larger to true size. ... Not true to size.  larger to true size. May need to buy one size down from your normal size.
3400,1,B076QD9NP1,0,Ok dress My daughter did not like the feel of this dress. She is very picky when it comes to the feel of fabric for her clothing.
3401,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Order a size up I returned this product great quality but came a bit small eife didn't like them
3402,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Poorly made These would be nice and fit great... If the right leg wasn't tighter than the left leg. Obviously poorly made. Waste of money.
3403,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Cute Dress but FITS WAY SMALL! The dress itself is very cute and nicely made but runs VERY VERY small.  My granddaughter is 8 years old and loves to wear cute sundresses.  I bought her this dress in a couple of different patterns in girls size M(10/12) which according to the size chart would fit a girl either 8-9 years old or 10-11 years old.  As a matter of fact the tag inside the dresses I received stated 8/9 year old.  The dress was so small I would guess it was more suitable for a 6 year old.  I returned both of the dresses.  I was bummed out.  Order larger size than needed.
3404,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Comfy but defective Loved this dress but I washed it once and the strap broke
3405,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Neleus Women's 3 Pack Compression Shirts Long Sleeve The shirt was ok on material an workmanship. It was to small. I had to buy the larger one.
3406,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Order a bigger size than normal Material super thin. Size ran super small.
3407,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Really cheap, looks and feels like cheap bad quality. Bad cheap and cheesy.  I suppose the bargain should have been an indication of quality.  I followed the reviews and regret it."
3408,3,B07XD71F1H,0,This winter fabric was tighter than expected. Wanted to have a short dress for Fall weather.
3409,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Defective Armholes vit unevenly.  Will be returning product. Color was nice
3410,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"These shirts run small It doesn't fit, runs really small."
3411,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"The hoodie material has terrible pilling after just one wash. Pros:<br />The color is a rich purple which is just what I wanted.<br />It is warm and comfortable.<br />I am able wear it under jackets and a coat without feeling that my outerwear is too bulky.<br />The seams are well done.<br />The ties are braided cord with protective plastic around the ends to lessen fraying.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The hood is too large so that when using the ties the hood slips over my forehead.<br />After one washing in cold water and drying at the permanent press setting, it came out with terrible pilling like would be found with an inexpensive sweater might.  I have fleece sweat shirts and pants that I have had for over 20 years that have never shown any pilling.<br /><br />For such an expensive item, I am very disappointed that the material is badly flawed."
3412,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"See through!!!! I ordered this dress in royal blue and the material is so incredibly thin that the entire dress is see through. The particular dress I received had white deodorant marks on it so I’m assuming it was already returned at least once. Would not recommend, will be returning!"
3413,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Great for smaller people, not so great for larger women. They are for smaller people, fit ok just showed every single problem area instead of kinda tucking or hiding like some leggings. They are very cute though and would be great workout leggings if they fit and look good!"
3414,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Three Stars I like the dress, but it is too tight across the back and around the bust area."
3415,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Like colors Not exactly what I was expecting but will save for warmer weather. Didn’t notice it was “T-shirt” material
3416,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Over priced Gildan Hoodies. These are over priced Gildan hoodies. The only thing “Joes USA” about them is their logo screen printed behind the Gildan tag. Great sweatshirts, but save yourself half the cost and search for Gilman hoodies instead."
3417,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Too big For compression shirts I thought I'd need my size I usually wear, large. It was not compression! Material was fine and tanks were nice just too big for what I wanted it."
3418,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Extreme disappointment I ordered the color “charcoal”... does this look charcoal to you? I feel deceived and my closest return location for this issue is 20 minutes away. Don’t count on getting what you ask for. Disappointed is an understatement.
3419,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars I like the fabric of the dress but the bust area was to small.
3420,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Don’t buy Not a sweater, made of T-shirt material"
3421,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not worth trying at all This is not a compressive shirt...your better off buying an Underarmour shirt.
3422,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Too large I ordered a large size which I new the x-large was way to big. These are cut way big. I’ll try a medium
3423,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Great sweatpants but don’t expect the writing to last The sweat pants themselves are great and I originally would have given them a 5 star review. The issue I have is after a few washes, the glitter writing down the leg is all but gone and is only faintly visible and look 10 years old. Bummer because I really liked these pants."
3424,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,One Star JUNK
3425,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Way too big for me! These fit rather big on me. I am a size 8 normally and not very busty but I weigh about 150. I ordered a medium based on the reviews I read and they were way too big. Definitely not form fitting on me. The material is also very thin.
3426,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Meh... I was underwhelmed by this cardigan.  The one I got was irregular,  had hanging threads, and is super-light weight.  It is more like a cotton shirt, rather anything you'd use for warmth.  As other reviewers have said, it also is a lot shorter than the advertisement picture suggests. Also, the colors are much darker than the picture suggests.  They are a bit muddier and not as vibrant. Its too much trouble to send back, and I've worn it to work once or twice-- but it'll probably be something that I just use to cover with around the house."
3427,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Liked the leggings, but sizing is inconsistent and customer service isn’t great I ordered three different pairs of these leggings in the same size, but I found that the sizing varied quite a bit from color to color. The charcoal grey marl pair in particular fit a lot tighter and shorter (more of a 7/8 length than a full length) compared to the other two I ordered. Otherwise I liked the style and colors of the leggings.<br /><br />Their packaging says to contact them if there are any issues with quality or sizing, and that they will 100% solve any problems. So I reached out to them about exchanging the leggings I received for a pair that was the correct size, but they just responded saying that the sizing differences were normal and that sizing will vary because the leggings are made at different times. They never got back to me about an exchange or replacement. I’ll probably be returning the leggings."
3428,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Two Stars DID NOT LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOK ON ME SENT BACK TO SELLER WITH NO PROBLEMS
3429,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Silly tanks It's like a tight tank top...nothing compressed about it...think I was looking for something to hold form..
3430,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Be wary... This wasn't a love for me.. not sweater material at all very flimsy... you get what you pay for, probably won't be bad over a tank top on cooler summer nights. The length definitely isn't as pictured either"
3431,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Good but not great I’m usually a large but ordered a size up as suggested and glad I did! However I feel like they are thin and a little short in the arms. The shirt lays above my wrist bone and I prefer workout shirts a little longer.
3432,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Love the fit but sadly the color already fading after first wash. Love the fit but already fading after first wash. Shame since it’s made so well and fits beautifully.
3433,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Okay. Doesn’t compress much.
3434,1,B09M6X79V9,0,... Standards me too small for American standards I don't recommend them unless you're on a 4 year Shirts come in a too small for American Standards me too small for American standards I don't recommend them unless you're on a 4 year old
3435,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Sizing sucks-be prepared to return Sizing is so screwed up. I ordered XL, and they sent a L. Those fit ok, I just like mine looser. Traded for an XL, those arrived and are even smaller than the L. Not worth the hassle of returning and trying again. Don’t reccomend"
3436,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"I received used tank I just received my set of 3 tank shirts  , and come to open them and the black tank had white deodorant marks all over it , how disgusting !!! Will be sending back ASAP"
3437,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Small Head Hole The colour was nice but the head hole was soo small on this.. I didn’t want to bother returning it so I donated it, maybe some kids head will fit."
3438,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not happy This was not what I expected. To me compression means like it would form to the body. This was just like an undershirt with no support around the belly.
3439,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Comfortable, not quality These are comfortable, however, I bought them in March and they are coming apart at the seam in the butt area. They do not fit tight on me so there was no strain on them."
3440,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,I returned them They seemed to fit ok but I couldn't get over the Very visible seam stitching. And even though I got them to be under shirts It just looked very cheap.
3441,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Nothing about this product is true to short It’s not long like it’s supposed to be and it’s to small not a 2x like should be. Material isn’t good at all falling apart I’m sending it back
3442,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,Thick material for running Comfortable and soft shirt but material feels too thick and heavy for long distance running and running on hot summer days
3443,2,B076QD9NP1,0,Dress fell apart! This is the 2nd dress we have bought and the first one is great. This one however came apart after being washed! My daughter is very sad as the other dress we bought is her favorite and after wearing this once she declared it her 2nd favorite dress. Very disappointing 😕.
3444,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Seam ripped open first day Have to send it back since the seam ripped open

They are my go-to hoodie, I've owned about 6 of these over the past few years.  they fit me comfortably.  The zipper &#34;handle&#34; thing breaks off of them easily, and on a couple pairs, the stitching in the pocket began to unravel.  But for the price, that is a very slight problem.  I just replace them."
3450,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cheap Appearance but fits to body shape. Colors are dull, not as shown on image.<br />Garment it self appears to have cheap finishing.<br />However, it fits right to size.<br />I rather spent a little more on branded tanks."
3451,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,These are not compression shirts Compression shirts are not extremely thin fabric that lack compression capabilities. It's a waste of money.
3452,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Damaged goods The shirt itself is great but 1 can sliced across the mid section. I tried to reach out for a replacement but cannot get ahold of the seller. Disappointed!

3454,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Do not waste your money! I bought three pairs of these. Pink ones came with hole in pocket. Gray pair the eyelet around drawstring came off after one wear. The blue gray pair have a hole in the crotch after one wear. I am disgusted!

If you are looking for a product that will hug your body nicely for a tone look then get this in a size smaller than your regular but if you want baggy and unsatisfying then get your regular size. The hood is very rhing and annoyingly flaps around like a dead weight and is more for looks than utility
3463,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Look elsewhere. Ordered thisnsweatshirt in Large. I'm 6', 193. Athletic build. It didnt have a whole of extra length before I washed it. It has a very puffy fit. Not long but fat and puffy in the body, the sleeves arent real long. After washing once the sleeves drew up and were too short. So i sent it back. It made me look like a frumpy pumpkin."
3464,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Starting to rip after one use I’m very disappointed! I just bought another 3 pack after buying these tanks before. After 1 use & 1 wash the material is starting to break apart and there are now lines where it is beginning to unravel.
3465,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Received very quickly, has a hole in the leg 2nd pair also has holes. Received very quickly, has a hole in the leg and I haven't even put them on yet.  Noticed the pocket also had a hole.  Received a 2nd pair in dark blue a couple days later, and both pockets have holes also."
3466,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Order a couple sizes bigger It fit a lot smaller than expected
3467,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Fit small I would order a size up as these fit really tight. I am an XL in rebook and got a 2XL and they are very tight
3468,2,B09M6X79V9,0,For workout I thought they was cotton.
3469,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not the best workout tank Thin material
3470,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Style looks different - odd stitching in the back. ... Style looks different - odd stitching in the back.  -good price but I didn't think I would wear so I returned.
3471,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars Nice color and very comfy. But a little too baggy on me.
3472,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Uncomfortable These are the most uncomfortable workout pants I have ever worn. I purchased my normal size and the waist constantly rolls down. They are not squat proof either. Very disappointed!
3473,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Awful Shipping/Incorrect Color This is a GREAT QUALITY item, which I have ordered before…..HOWEVER…This time the item was delivered only in a thin plastic mailer and not wrapped in any type of plastic. It’s a WHITE sweatshirt and has small patches of dirt on it from where holes were poked during handling. Also, this is not VINTAGE WHITE. Vintage white is an off white/ivory color. This is regular white. Unfortunately, I need the item for THIS WEEK and will not have time to reorder somewhere else. Definitely missed the mark."
3474,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Three Stars the top half of this dress was very large and hung down very far
3475,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Workout tank tops that keep you cool with a silky feel I really do like them for working out they keep you nice and cool
3476,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Pretty good I was kind of hoping the material would be a little bit thicker but other than that I like it
3477,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Only 2 of 3 shirts were in the package Only 2 of the 3 arrived
3478,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Really like this dress Really like this dress.  Quality is about a 6-7, which is to be expected given price.  Love it after a hot day at the pool or beach"
3479,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Very long and tight Fit really weird. VERY tight and very long in the sleeves and body. Not for me, I returned. I would not get a size larger."
3480,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Russell Sweatshirt Not like my old Russel sweatshirt .....sleeves are extra extra long.
3481,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Poor quality Well....I'm pretty sure I didn't order a pair with a hole so I'm not sure why I was sent one. Not pleased at all.
3482,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Not for me! I had to return these shirts because I just didn't like the way they fit. I'm the thinnest I have been in a long time, but I don't care for how tight they were around the belly area. Perhaps they are fine for a different body type, just not mine."
3483,2,B009R09Z8W,0,"Save your money Fits well, nice color and texture until I washed it, terribly quality, you're better off spending $60 on a brand hoodie."
3484,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Cheap material Really cheap material
3485,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Need to size up Need to size up on this. Was a little too snug
3486,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Comfy but not my favorite Comfy, but seem to have stretched out after only a couple of washes. They are constantly falling down now when I wear them. (Wish I could blame it on weight loss, but sadly that’s not the case!) They have also snagged easily and are starting to ball up only a month into owning them. They’ve turned into ‘at home only’ pants for me already."
3487,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars The mediums look a little small. My daughter is 5'3'' and 130lbs.  and it's a smudge small.
3488,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Buyers beware Item I received was worn by someone with a lot of hair and the pocket was torn
3489,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Short in the back I loved it, accidentally ordered 2, but it's just so short in the back, no butt coverage, and shrunk horribly"
3490,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Color not close - its a darker brown The picture for this item - Print 101 - shows that it is a tan/olive like color. It's a very strong brown that really overpowers the design. Nowhere near as nice looking.
3491,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Dirty White shirt was dirty/stained when it came in
3492,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Sleeves are Ridiculously BIG Purchased size SMALL and the sleeves are big enough to fit a professional bodybuilder ... With room to spare.  Returned.
3493,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not what I expected. Small around the bust and torn when I received it.
3494,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Three Stars I should have gotten a size larger
3495,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,The back of cardigan don't go all the way down. The back dose not go all the way down like the front.
3496,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Sleeves have gotten shorter over the years. I have several older Russell sweatshirts and liked them a lot.  They were 2-3 years old.  I bought 2 in the past month, one was this hoodie, the other with no hood.  The sleeves on both are at least an inch shorter than the old sweatshirts.  I sent one back, gave the hoodie to a nephew, and am now buying my sweatshirts from a local store where I can try them on.  Whoever is now making the Russell sweatshirts is trying to save on material cost by taking it out of the sleeves, I guess."
3497,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Dress not fully assembled Unfortunately for such a cute and lightweight dress; it’s not fully assembled. At least mine was not. There’s a strap that was never fed through the back of the dress. I’ve never assembled clothing, but if you’ve ever lost the string out of your sweatpants and tried to feed it back through, imagine that.<br /><br />Not exactly what I want to be doing with a dress I just bought. I did try, probably for way too long, and I don’t think it’s possible for the average human. (Maybe some of you are above average, I must not be).<br /><br />What’s worse for me is that I didn’t realize this until after the return date. So now I’m stuck with this unusable dress. Unless I can find one of you above average humans out there... Not sure that it’s worth it. The quality of the dress is almost similar to that of slip, which is fine for the what I intended to use it for. Just a light dress. I guess we will see what comes of this. Really expensive rag or maybe you’re below average fellow amazon user will learn to sew and make something of this."
3498,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Arrived dirty/used Quality of shirts seems good. But I am very disappointed that upon opening my package I notice one of the shirts is dirty and all of them are full of pet hair (dog or cat not sure).
3499,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Don’t waste your money Normally a medium fits fine but I like my sweats baggy so I sized up.  This morning with nothing clean and having to get my dog to the vet, I reached for these. TIGHT!  I thought, oh well, it will have to work. Got in the car and realized a small tear on the outer part of the right leg. WTH?  While waiting for the vet I came to my app and hit return. Of course, by the time I got home I was covered in dog hair. So I won’t be returning them. I might as well have flushed the money down the toilet.  I’m really disappointed."
3500,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Big and comfy Nice hoodie but I saw some review saying to go 2X for 6' 210 lbs. ummm, not necessary. It's a big loose cut of a hoodie to begin with but they're nice and comfy. I'm sure a size smaller would be fine for humans that size."
3501,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Tight Fit This sweatshirt is pretty much like most sweatshirts. It's only a 'little' too small when you try it on before it's washed, then after it's washed it's two sizes too small. I gave my new sweatshirt to someone that wears a medium and it's tight on them! Either buy one that's 2 sizes too big, or be smart and save your money."
3502,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Qué se ajuste vien Se me baja mucho, la cintura es demasiado floja."
3503,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not as advertised, not tight, flares out but still cute. These are not what I though. When you sell a compression shirt it should be super tight and fit snug. These are loose and flare out. They are cute and I can still wear them but not what I wanted so pretty disappointed about the false advertising."
3504,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not the best Leggings look how they are supposed to look but they fit so stiff and hardly have any stretch to them
3505,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Order different brand To small for a large size
3506,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Wore it around all day yesterday and loved the breathability while doing house chores Very cute! I purchased the dress in red and it makes me want to go to Disneyland and purchase some Minnie ears. Wore it around all day yesterday and loved the breathability while doing house chores. Great for the price, might want to grab some nipple covers or a complementing bralette. Small chested women should have no problem going natural."
3507,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not a maxi. I do love the material but wish it were actually a maxi dress. I’m 5’6” and it lands several inches above my ankle and I like my dresses long. The hem is so small that it wouldn’t really make a difference if I took it out.
3508,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"More like a legging instead of a jogger I was expecting a jogger, but these were tight like a legging."
3509,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star Way too small :/ im 163lbs and the XL didn't fit
3510,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Not all that great.
3511,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not compression They are a great shirt! But I would definitely not call them compression, so that was a little disappointing. But definitely a solid tank"
3512,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,sizing different than other colors I bought these leggings in this pink color as well as grey and black. The pink leggings were noticeably longer when compared to the other colors. They were extremely high waisted to the point it was not flattering. Love the leggings other than that!
3513,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Three Stars Cute dress, but it runs small. Order up one size."
3514,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,to big to big
3515,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Great dress I love the flow of the dress. I dislike that the chest area is too tight.  Seems are slightly off<br />But overall it is one of my favorite dresses
3516,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Nice, but wrong item!!! Nice ""hoodie"".  But I ordered a cadet neck sweatshirt!  But I kept it despite that error because the hoodie is a great fit and looks and feels great when I am wearing it.  too bad.....won't trust them to get it right the next time so will look for another vendor."
3517,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not a fan Ordered a small and it’s still not tight enough but it’s only waist length and I’m 6’1 270+lbs
3518,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Runs Very SMALL I am usually an XL, I ordered this in a 4XL bc reviews said it runs 2 sizes small. The sleeves are very long, the cardigan length is not what the photo shows. It does not cover the back end. The material is okay, I'll have to see when its washed. Overall its cheap but doable."
3519,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,not flattering or comfortable Pants are not flattering or comfortable. The fabric was thin. Would not recommend.
3520,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"wish there was an XS... I am 5'6, 150 pounds and I normally get size small sweatshirts so I was assuming a small would be appropriate. However, the small fit more like a medium so I'm just going to try to shrink it, although I'm not sure how well that will work out since its 50-50 poly cotton."
3521,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not a typical compression garment. Wasn't what I expected in a compression garment. It's more of a workout shirt. Though it offers no compression I wear for my workouts.
3522,3,B076QD9NP1,0,Didn’t hold up after first wash This dress is super cute and my daughter loves it but after first wash it had two holes in the neckline. Ordered a replacement. Will repost after washing it.
3523,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Brought them too big. I should have brought them in a smaller size so they would support me better.
3524,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Extremely small [[VIDEOID:baf23ae09cfada333130f69f9160bc6]] Extremely small. I ordered a 3x because I wanted baggy workout shirts. These were SKIN TIGHT! In the photo I have it sitting on a XL from Target and it's about half the size
3525,1,B09M6X79V9,0,These are NOT compression tanks in any way! I was going to use them to workout.  Very disappointed!
3526,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Run big Run big, get a size smaller!"
3527,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Runs small I bought it teo sizes to big thinking it would fit great. And yet it feels like a small
3528,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Quality I like the fleece lining and fitted cuffs
3529,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"🤷🏼‍♀️ There was a hole in the pocket, and two on the left leg seams."
3530,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Way too small! I ordered 3xl and they fit like a xl
3531,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Not good Runs way too small ! Color is diff and the printing is poor !
3532,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Too small. Did not follow the size description Too small
3533,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"good, but need to check items for stains before you ship out Love the style and fit however one shirt arrived with stains on it.  The white one.  I wanted to have them send me a replacement but was only given the option to return."
3534,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Runs big Runs incredibly large and long, big arm holes. I bought an XL, I could comfortably wear a medium in this. Thin material, which is what I wanted. I'll wear it around the house."
3535,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Two Stars Like the dress has a seam up the front that clearly is mismatched in alignment of pattern.
3536,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Did not find them compression wear. Nice tank tops but I found the run too large to be considered compression wear. I listened to others and ordered next size up and that was mistake. I will keep as I like them as daily tank tops but definitely not compression wear’
3537,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Looks used It is a little on cheap side. Not very noticeable but some piling
3538,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Hole Came with a small hole on the front of the shirt that appeared to be glued back together from the inside.
3539,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I like the pattern and fabric but I'm a 38B and ... I like the pattern and fabric but I'm a 38B and the chest area is so tight it smashes me. The rest is fine, it's just made horribly and doesn't look or fit right. I also found it odd that the adjustments for the straps are in the front. At first I wasn't even sure which was the front or back but the back has a seam running down it and the design doesn't match up. That doesn't even really bother me as it is an inexpensive sun dress. Too bad, I had high hopes."
3540,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not worth buying Just like a tank top no control.
3541,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I liked the dress I liked the dress, but it wasn't true to size. Not even close ! I was so upset, I asked for an extra large. When I got it, I couldn't get it over my chest. I gave it to a friend at work that wears a 2. IT fit her fine so no way it would fit me !"
3542,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Too big This medium is really a large fit.<br />I am 5' 6"" weighing approx 140 lbs. It was way too big."
3543,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Shrinks Shrunk after washing
3544,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Order two sizes up. I wear an lx i ordered xl they are the size of a small. They stretch but not all too well. Thats a major downfall.
3545,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Quality, customer service I ordered the gray color in a Medium and I liked the way they fit and how they complement your shape. I'm 5'4 and 165pounds. However, I did experience a lot of rolling and what looked like menstrual staining. maybe I should have ordered a Large and a different color.  Unfortunately,  this will have to be a return. I wanted to like them because they have a great thickness and waist band compression.  Maybe i just got a bad pair of leggings.<br /><br />I contacted the seller. I told them my measurements,  and my experience with the menstrual staining. Customer service replied back to say that it was the warehouse not checking. However a replacement pair was not offered. Legging are great quality,  just disappointing customer service could be better."
3546,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,Colors! color great don't fit
3547,3,B009R09Z8W,0,... expected and looks different than the picture but still nice Bigger than expected and looks different than the picture but still nice
3548,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheaply made-wish.com grade 4 Looks and feels super cheap. Made in China and not only is it short but it is also small.
3549,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"easy to use The fabric is great at keeping body cool when working out.<br />It has a light hold of your form & is comfy. Guys and gals can use this,"
3550,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Nice for summer There is a seam down the middle front and no seam on the back. Should’ve reversed that.
3551,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Buy a Smaller Size Bought the recommended size. Way too big. These are compression shirts but didn't hug any part of my arms or torso. Gave the product a two only because I can't comment on whether they moisture wick, protect from the sun or are good for working out. Perhaps they deserve a better rating."
3552,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Rides up too much I liked most everything except the length.  They are a little short and ride up with more movement. I purchased a larger size because my stomach isn't flat, usually a 2XLT works. They are moisture wicking and comfortable in the chest and arms."
3553,1,B09M6X79V9,0,I asked for a large but received an extra large I didn’t get the right size in which I purchased
3554,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Ok but not very soft If you're looking for comfy and soft sweats try the Bebe brand.  These are just not nearly as comfortable.
3555,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,They run big Very disappointed.  They are larger that actual size
3556,1,B09M6X79V9,0,All 3 were different sizes and are NOT bras. These are tank tops and each color was a different size.
3557,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"The rest is fine, but why are the arms made so huge The arms are so huge! The rest is fine, but why are the arms made so huge?!"
3558,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,The sweatshirts looked great but were extremely LARGE Size chart was incorrect.  The sweatshirts looked great but were extremely LARGE.  I reluctantly returned them.
3559,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Great hoodie, bad customer service. I bought this hoodie originally about 5 months ago. I bought the off-white ('sand') colored one. It was a fine lightweight cheap hoodie and exactly the style I was looking for. That hoodie got ruined by something I spilled on it so I ordered another.<br /><br />The new one arrived about a week ago and even though I selected the right color and the label on the bag it came in was the right color, it was totally off. It was this gross dark brown color.<br /><br />So I thought, okay fine was probably just a mix-up. I return it and order another. The second one comes and the exact same thing. So because Amazon's UI is terrible and I can't find a way to directly contact the seller I've just decided to go buy a different one from a more competent on-brand company.<br /><br />I really liked that first hoodie, but I can't stand a company making the same mistake twice."
3560,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Size up up up These are smaller then expected but I still wear them around the house to clean
3561,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,No Good Fits weird. Got these for working out and the material is not what I expected. Don’t like em at all
3562,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,not real flattering looks cheap
3563,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Tight waistband around waistline I didn’t like that it’s too tight on the waistband and loose on the stomach part.  Doesn’t hold stomach in.  I have similar style pink leggings that are much mor comfortable as they don’t have that tight band around the waistline.
3564,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Fake advertising Looked like the Ts I usually get but the grab on to your skin
3565,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Run big , made well Kind of bigger than expected as I wear a 38DD"
3566,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"It is very delicate and the threads go away. It is cute, it gives a good body, but delicate, the threads do not go away at all."
3567,3,B09M6X79V9,0,These are for layering. You need a bra with them. Very thin material. I was expecting the tops to be more supportive and there is no support. 36D
3568,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Read reviews before buying The color I ordered is not the color I received. I ordered a darker color and received hot pink.  Misleading.
3569,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Very small Very tight for medium and thick material. You need a sport bra for some support.
3570,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Very tight I always wear medium joggers, but these mediums fit like leggings on me. I kept them because the material is super nice, but if you’re looking for a lounge/workout jogger be warned these are very form fitting."
3571,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,IT RUNS VERY SMALL Its does not fit like the picture. I got a large and it is like a kids size 12. I like the pattern and I will return it for a larger size.
3572,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,It’s small and made of cheap material Remember those generic jerseys that you wore in gym class as a kid? These are pretty much the same thing.
3573,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Poorly made. I wear a larger, bought extra large and they are fitting like a large and snug. I bought them for Christmas. Had them on 4 times since and the material has bumpy cloth balls on it as if I'd had the pants for years. Poorly made."
3574,1,B0B16Q1854,0,All semis come undone. Comfort softness and stretch is great seeing sucks
3575,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,was not true to size. I ordered 1 size ... was not true to size. I ordered 1 size larger then I normally wear and it was still a little snug.
3576,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Buy in USA only for plus size. Runs small I order couple pairs and wash 2 before wearing they really shrunk. Grandkids happy.
3577,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not lose fitted This isn't a lose fit fabric but rather one that sucks to your body, great if you are skinny, but if you have any meat on your bones then you probally wont like the look"
3578,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"The colour differs completely from the one in the picture I ordered the wine red marl one. It looks pinkish in the photos, yet, I received purple leggings, and it wasn’t even a nice purple.<br /><br />Also, the size doesn’t match the reality. The small might well be an extra small. I am 105 lbs and the small feels way too tight."
3579,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Definitely a No Shirts were way too thin and felt really cheap. The fabric felt like tight, thin underwear fabric instead of shirt material. Fit like sausage casing. Might have been OK for a base layer of some kind under a shirt, but not good for wearing alone. I guess you get what you pay for."
3580,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,I hated them. I hated them.  Returned them.
3581,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Do not buy if you are tall These are very short if you are over 6 foot tall they will not fit you

3584,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"A compression base should be as compression, not a loose item. My size is large, but this product is too big for large size. I ordered in order to wear under my cloth as compression item."

3594,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Super tight So these thermals are NOT cotton thermals. I wear Med but got the large and it’s still tight. They’re not soft. I’m just not pleased with them.

3598,1,B09M6X79V9,0,The material is not what I was expecting. It’s a shiny material and not flattering . Did not like the fit or material. Looks really cheap.
3599,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,DO NOT BUY ANYMORE I have purchased this in the past and it lasted 2 yrs before fading. It was a great sweatshirt.<br />BUT NOT NOW.<br />DO NOT BUY ANYMORE!!<br />The quality of this sweatshirt fabric now is totally unacceptable! Pilling in very first washing ruined it and every other item in the wash load. Fabric continued pilling in second wash as bad. Fabric basically fell apart. i have pictures to document.<br />Wish I could give negative stars.
3600,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Too small. Fits way too small, pretty sure it would fit my 8 year old daughter. The sleeves didn't even come half way down my arms."
3601,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Size up Normally I’m a size larg but because I know that the majority of clothes on line run small I knew I had to get a bigger size. Fits as expected but not for a size 2x. I expected it to fit a bit more looser & I expected the sleeves to be more fitting but it’s loose but not by a lot. Despite all of that the material is soft & it looks good.

3603,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Misleading Misleading. These are cut for tween and should be labeled ""Juniors"". Also the fabric is cheap and flimsy. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with Ralph Lauren. I was a fan for years but no more"

3609,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Too good to be true I’m so so sad about this. I really wanted this to work. It’s that old bathing suit material that says and hangs off the body in the most unflattering way. I think I’m going to try to stich it so it is smaller because I really wanted to wear this for my daughters birthday party.
3610,1,B09M6X79V9,0,I'm so disappointed in these t-shirts Doesn't fit properly
3611,1,B09M6X79V9,0,disappointment not compression tanks at all. very disappointed as item doesn’t fit the description at all. i first ordered large based on the size chart. then ordered medium as the large were way too large. now i have both large and medium and both are too large and both are not compression tanks as described.

3618,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars Not a fan of this sweatshirt. Arms are very long but the shirt is well made.

3622,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"not squat proof i’ve bought these leggings in 3 colors and wanted a new pair so got a new color. for some reason the blue aren’t as compressing as my other pairs from the same brand, these are also more see through. i wouldn’t recommend for a leg day or cardio"
3623,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Flimsy Material I wear this dress with leggings.  You can dress it up or down.  However,  the fabric is very flimsy. And there are no pockets. I knew that when I bought it, but pockets are sorely missed here."
3624,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"seam down the middle of the front The seam for this dress was right down the front, based on where the tag is and how the pockets are sewn in, which makes it pretty much unwearable. I'm returning it.  Could have been a fluke, but I personally didn't like the pattern that much in person either so I'm not going to bother reordering."
3625,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Comfortable. Low quality. A comfortable well fitting sweater. Lasted one day. I WAS roughhousing, but all the stitches came out and it literally fell apart.<br /><br />*I had purchased 2 for outdoor use. Each of them lasted one day. Wore them hiking... but just wearing a backpack and walking through the brush tore them to shreds. I mean ripped apart with holes and gashes. I wasn't even mad it was so amazing."

3633,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Different sizes from first order. Shirts run a lot smaller from the first order I received.
3634,1,B0928FSGGD,0,Ordered two sets only able to return one??? One pack was black red and gray which I was able to return I also needed to return the purple pink and blue one but it’s not giving me the option to return it

Har to fight it on.<br />Long story short.... the XL I received are smedium’s.<br />I’d go as far as smalls.

3639,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Comfortable, soft fabric Very light weight fabric, breathable.  Totally amazed that cat hair doesn’t stick to it like my other yoga pants!  Very Loose fit in legs, not at all flattering from behind.  Comfortable wide waistband. Pilling in pocket area After first time in washing machine.."
3640,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Not worth purchase, too short. It's really thin and very short in the back. It looks and feels odd to wear. It is already in the give away pile, I will never wear it."
3641,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not what I wanted I’m 5’2 135 pounds. I got a medium and it’s too big and too long. I wanted something more form fitting. Good for the gym but not for casual day use.
3642,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"The sizing isn’t accurate I bought 2 pairs of them. Same size, same style, etc. just different colors. One pair fits fine the other I can’t even get my leg into. The tag shows it’s the same size as the one that fits fine."

3645,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Love, but fits way too tight! Love the style and price, but really run small. Don't like something is tight across my chest ."
3646,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Fell apart in washer/dryer before even wearing Though I found a cute summer lounge dress for relaxing days. so cheaply made I could never wear it. Destroyed in 1st wash.
3647,3,B09M6X79V9,0,OK Has to return these items as I found the material really thin.
3648,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Run small I wear a medium in regular shirts so I thought with compression shirts, I should get a L as I like them close-fitting but not skin tight.  These are skin tight.  I don't know yet if that will be a deal breaker as I haven't worn them or if they will be warm under my work t-shirts.  But product fit is small."
3649,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression material Thin material.
3650,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression These are not long as advertised.  They offer no compression support either.  Baggy and loose.
3651,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Pattern issues It’s very flowly and I love the adjustable straps. Great for someone who’s 5’3” and has a hard time finding longer dresses. I just can’t help the seam issues in the front. It’s all I notice!!! Not a fan and I will be returning. Maybe a different pattern would be better as I like the material and flow. The pockets were a little low for me as well.
3652,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Dirty not new with food stains The sweater was use not new it had food stains.I was upset but my son did not wanted to send it back . We washed.
3653,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Too long Again.  Too sloppy long for him.  Must be at the waist.  Donation, again."
3654,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Comfortable Thinner material than i like... i may need a smaller size.
3655,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Straps are confusing I can't figure out the straps. I should return it.

3657,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Mala calidad y con un pequeño agujero en una pierna ☹️ Dislike
3658,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS! The length of it only came midway if my calves, it is a way smaller fit, cheaply made. The only thing that they got right was, black, & the polka dots! 😭😬💔"
3659,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Too short Buy a size or 2 up. And this is very short. It hits right at pant waist line.
3660,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Stained One of the shirts came with a stain on it.  I hope they're durible becasue i ended up with 2 for the price of 3
3661,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Don’t like fabric Not for me
3662,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression Not compression as described
3663,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not what I expected. I ordered the 100% cotton sweatshirt (3 times) and it was 85/15, not what I thought/hoped I was getting.  All three are 86ed and being returned."
3664,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Normally wear a medium and went one size larger so ... Normally wear a medium and went one size larger so it would be longer. The fit is OK but it still wasn’t long enough. If you’re doing a lot of overhead reach as part of your workout and have a long torso, it still probably won’t cover you."
3665,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"This dress is really cute on, but poorly made ... This dress is really cute on, but poorly made.  Don't buy it unless you are handy with a needle and thread.  Both straps snapped and came unsewn within an hour of putting it on and I had to scramble to find safety pins.  They were simple to sew back on afterward, but it could have been really embarrassing if I hadn't been wearing a bathing suit underneath."
3666,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not so oversized I was excited when some reveiws mentioned it was on the larger size. I am usually a S-M but wanted to size up to get a really oversized fit. I have the same brand jersey in red from goodwill in a large so I thought it would be fine. It was not as big as I expected. Should have gotten an XL. Too much to return so I will just have to deal.
3667,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"It shrinks… Loved it at first wore it once, I put it in the washer, hung to dry and it shrank. I want my money back. Not worth it. Don’t buy."
3668,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Size Runs very small for size I can fit a 2x so I ordered a size up to be safe and it is way to small so I gave them to my niece who wears a women’s size medium and they fit perfectly on her
3669,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"Wanted to love this dress I was a bit disappointed with this dress, not because of the fit, fabric or print. I ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly, but I kept trying this dress on to see what it looked on me. Answer awful, and I don’t know why. But I persisted and today thought to wear it as a top over wide leg pants and over a gray tank top et voila looks good. I can’t really tell you why, but as a dress, from the waist down made me look kind of dumpy. Love the print and comfortable fabric content."
3670,2,B076QD9NP1,0,Low Quality Low quality printing on the fabric. There are parts where the printing was very flawed. I returned mine.
3671,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Don't Buy It I took a chance even after the mixed reviews, so my fault I suppose. The shipping came within the time frame, however it still took over a month. Upon opening the plastic wrap it stunk so bad of chemical. I ordered an XL which is a size up from what I typically wear and I still couldn't even get the dress over my chest (I wear a 34DD).  Holding the maxi up to my body the dress only fell about mid calf (I'm 5'6"", so average), way to short for a maxi. I believe this was suppose to come with pockets as well which mine didn't, not a huge problem but still a problem. Not happy with my purchase I decided to request a return, the seller did respond but the email was unreadable and was just a bunch of computer code. So all in all I'm now stuck with a stinky ""maxi"" dress that will never fit (unless I lose half my weight and 6"") and out the money I spent. So unless you're the size of a 13yo, I DO NOT SUGGEST you buy this ""maxi"" from this seller."
3672,3,B0B16Q1854,0,says ladies but fits like mens I bought these and made sure it said for ladies but the pockets sit real low and feel like mens
3673,1,B09M6X79V9,0,It is more like a size for teenage girls I ordered a size large I weigh 152 lb and it was more like a crop top than a tank top to work out in
3674,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Terrible quality! Terrible quality dress!
3675,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Two Stars A lot shorter than it looks in the picture
3676,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small Runs small would have liked the medium or even large I’m a 34c the fabric feels cheap and would be hot to workout in
3677,3,B097RFTKJP,0,Almost perfect I like the dress and it fits nice. Only issue is it's a printed color on a white dress any stretching show white.
3678,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Used and smelly Arrived in a plastic ziplock. All 3 were clearly used and smelled like a sweaty ...<br /><br />Do not trust.
3679,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not Flattering Terrible quality very short not good fabric and not flattering at all
3680,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not a shaping under shirt! Know this in advance. Very soft material, extremely comfortable, just like spandex. It’s nice and feed it, but if you don’t have already a nice body this will not help you shape or retain the love handles or the belly. It’s more like her favorite shirt nor a shaping shirt."
3681,2,B09M6X79V9,0,To tight Did not like at all. I’m usually a l/xl in tops and it’s to small. Don’t like the material.
3682,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Doesn't fit as described too small
3683,2,B009R09Z8W,0,Like a cheap hoodie Not what I expected feels and fits like a cheap hoodie not worth the 28 dollars I paid . Not buying any more Joe’s products over priced low quality goods
3684,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,No me gustan Material no es muy bueno
3685,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Order a smaller one than the size chart might indicate I measured my body and ordered the XL size. According to the data image on the product page an XL compression shirt is the correct size to order for those with a chest measuring 39-41.5in. My chest measurment is 43 so I ordered XL expecting it to be very snug in the chest and a bit loose in the waist. It's a nice shirt that fits generally skin tight but it offers ZERO noticable Compression. I'm not unhappy with the fit but it's certainly not fitting like the compression shirt that I thought I was ordering would. I will probably exchange for the smaller size.
3686,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"NOT COMPRESSION GEAR Bought for my husband who had a surgery and needed compression on his chest. This is a big joke. Material is so lax and stretchy it doesn’t compress a thing! Basically I should have just put a t shirt on him, would have had the same effect. Not a good product, should not be called compression shirts."
3687,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"White shirt was damaged When received my item was very excited. The fit was true to size. The black and red shirts were fine but noted the red shirt dye damaged the white. I washed it thinking it would go away, it actually damaged the white shirt.  This was upsetting because the shirts are good quality and very durable. My daughter uses them for lacrosse."
3688,2,B0B16Q1854,0,Mine came with a hole in it! Very disappointed! Customer service never communicated with me. Very disappointed in this product and seller!
3689,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,I'm sure it will obviously depend on how big you ... I'm sure it will obviously depend on how big you are but as a normal wearer of M tees this was rather larger than normal.
3690,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Not flattering. My housemate said “Don’t wear those outside the house.” They are that unflattering. Comfort is fine, but not amazing. I would have returned them if not for Covid."
3691,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"Too small I'm 5'5"" about 150lbs, got an XL cuz I didn't want it too tight.  Sleeves are too short and shirt fits very snug for an XL.  Logo placement is weird and just looks bad.  I will not order again."
3692,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Comfy w a defect The right side pocket is sewn together so it’s not usable but comfy and fit as expected so I will deal w that...I bought my daughter a pair too and her pockets are fine.
3693,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Not good quality These are very thin, very cheaply made.  They are not soft at all.  Returned."
3694,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Nice logo Odd fit!! I love the beautifully large logo on these pants but i found them to be a bit to large to be a medium women and oddly wide at the hips though they are somewhat comfy the material is a bit thinner than what i would have liked. I wish they were thicker.
3695,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,One Star The fit is not true fit.
3696,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Size misrepresented I absolutely LOVE the colors, the material and the design. However, for most of my life, I have worn size Medium, so in order to have some lose roominess I ordered these T-Shirts in the X-Large size. But the X-Large size fits super snug to the point of being uncomfortably tight. TOO SMALL! There is NO roominess or breathing room."
3697,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"A little short on the torso I like my tank tops longer so that I'm sure that my back and stomach are covered when I raise my arms.  These shirts are almost too short.  So if you're hoping for that longer undershirt, this isn't it.  Other than that it was fine and the size was correct just shorter in the torso than I wanted."
3698,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,I love the color on it however this is a very ... I love the color on it however this is a very very very light sweater. It’s not heavy at all. But it’s cute more for the style the material is great just light.
3699,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Decent workout shirt It’s a decent shirt but it’s scratchy, they are extremely tight, for example I typically wear a Large and I even ordered a XL so it would be loose and they are skin tight on me."
3700,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Colors don't run the same material I bought the dark blue in XL and they were very stretchy borderline too big. So I bought the brown in size large. The material was less stretchy even tho the descriptions are the same. So now the larges are too small because it has less give. Probably gift them.
3701,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Horrible quality. Crazy hem. Crazy seams. It was horrible quality.
3702,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"Not worth it I usually wear an XL but when I ordered an XL it was too large. I bought 3 hoodies. (Red, green, and pink)  Because the hoodies were too large I had to return them. The shipping was expensive and I was not happy about that.  I will never buy these hoodies again."
3703,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Worst Quality The quality of the cloth is the worse, it feels like you are wearing a thin paper sheet , also it tore down in just one day , just from one wear. Sweat is not absorbed into the material and causes itching. I would not at all recommend this to anyone."
3704,1,B09M6X79V9,0,No shelf bra as listed. These DO NOT have a built in shelf bra as stated. I've contacted the company 2 times regarding it and got no response at all. Thus the 1 star review. If you're going to to purchase these you will need a yoga bra too.
3705,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Faded on 1st wash in cold water I loved this dress; fit great and comfortable to wear.  However, i washed it with like colors in cold water and the material faded dramatically. I bought the black one and it looks frayed.  So disgusted.  Guess i get what i paid for."
3706,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Love Russell. Love Russell.!! But man the size does not make sense!! I always wear XL, but this is more like XXL!! If not more!! Quality is second to non, but cut and size is off!! Must taper around the waist,and too long!!"
3707,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,The product pills up The product pills up
3708,2,B097RFTKJP,0,"Fabric flawed The dress is cute, fit well and I thought I would buy again. Then I noticed what looked like a large deodorant mark on the skirt. The garment must have come that way as I did not have deodorant on.<br />No worry, thought I would just throw it in the wash. Well it was not a stain. It was a flaw in the fabric. Like when it’s stretched too far and the elastic breaks and leaves little white broken threads.<br />So really cute, just this little flaw. Not a but again for me😔"
3709,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Not for Me I wanted black leggings that were squat proof and not sheer for my workouts. I ordered these leggings in black and they are neither. I was actually quite self conscious when working out because of these leggings… bummer wasted my $$ but now I know just to bite the bullet and go with trusted brands instead of trying to save a buck
3710,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Not well made
3711,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Color is off I ordered the “cyber pink”. I had been looking for that specific hue of pink in the picture with a kind of purple undertone. The picture is perfect but the actual hoodie delivered in a neon pink. its ugly. im so annoyed
3712,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Size smaller than claimed Fits too tight - no room for another layer underneath
3713,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Won't last long Pocket will fall off after 2 times in the washer

3716,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Fits great but what a big disappointment after one wash the ... Fits great but what a big disappointment after one wash the stitching and material completely unraveling  I don't know what this is definitely not a Russell sweatshirt getting this directly from Amazon I'm makes it more disappointing I may as  well took my money and literally flush it down the toilet what a waste will not buy again 👎🏽👎🏽
3717,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Three Stars Didn't realize compression ran so small. Need to return for larger size.
3718,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not flattering and runs small! Flattens in the bust and fabric is scratchy.  I returned it
3719,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Wrong size The sweatshirt was too large.  The cool was great.  I would it again if It was in store and I could find the correct size.
3720,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"GREAT PANTS, but wearing out easily. :( I like the pants, but already starting to fuzz & wear out. I have only had them for a month or less. :( Maybe it’s the quality of pants, but that part concerns me. Fabric? Smooth nice fabric, but wears out easily."
3721,2,B097RFTKJP,0,I gave it away...lol I don't like the material
3722,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Good hoodie but color is way off It’s a good hoodie, BUT the color is nothing like the picture. I was so disappointed since I was so excited for it to come. I specifically ordered it to match a pair of shoes. The color on the picture would have matched perfectly, but when the actual item arrived the color was nothing like the picture, so I felt like I just wasted money honestly.."
3723,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Unflattering and near see through If you have any cellulite whatsoever and wanna show it off to the world, these are for you! I got these in a grey, maybe it wouldn't be as bad in black or something darker. But I can't wear this out of the house."
3724,2,B009R09Z8W,0,"good for people with small heads, not normal size ones Neck too small"
3725,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,👎 I returned.  It’s not as expected. Too much material?  Too big?  Or I’ve not enough curves to do this dress justice. I return for someone else to give it a try.
3726,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Rip off This product should be worth much less since it’s quality is very low. Total rip off considering the price, I would recommend buying a different selection."
3727,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Too small Sadly they were not the right size, they were too small. I was suggested by Amazon to purchase a small, most of my leggings are small, (very few are mediums and those are said to run small). They seem like really good quality and im sure I would love them if they fit. ): I don't really know if you should size up?"
3728,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Nice breathable fabric, but size ran smaller than I expected. I like the fabric because its lightweight and breathable. I thought it would be a bit larger fit overall."
3729,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Little disappointed So I bought XL to have them I little over sized. The gray and blue are a good size. But the pink one runs smaller. Disappointed since that was the color that I wanted the most. It fits. But more snug then I wanted. The other thing is they all have a strong chemical smell. Going to have to wash them before I wear them.
3730,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Runs small Run very small!!!
3731,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Not new The sweat shirt is fine, except that it is not new. You can tell by the missing tags and the ones they attached probably after it had been returned. I am keeping the sweatshirt as it fits and it seems to be in good shape. However this feels like a slight of hand trick. ""Don't look too carefully this is not new."" If you are selling items that are not new a slight reduction in price seems fair."
3732,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Hated the fabric and fit Eh. Way too short. I hated the feeling of the material. Gave them to PTA the same day I received them.
3733,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Fit Not a compression top
3734,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Sizing seems to run large Fabric did not seem great quality and sizing runs large.
3735,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Meh. I really am so disappointed with this dress... I wanted to love it. There is a seam straight down the middle of the dress and the polka dot pattern does not line up and is mismatched. Same thing on the neck line. The same fabric is used and misaligned polka dots on top of polka dots is tacky. The dress fits very well but the patter and defects are too much. Back it goes.
3736,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Quality control issues Shirts are a good fit and breathable, but holy crap, quality control is lacking! Seems like each of the 3 shirts has something wrong with it, something I have to fix or sew. Hopefully seller can make this right or this is my last."
3737,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Ripped They ripped all apart in the first time I wore them
3738,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Man boobs welcomed I thought I’d look hot in these on my beach trip but I looked like a was wearing a oversized sports bra from the back. It held my boobs up but not what I was expecting.
3739,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,order a size larger i would order one size bigger than you normally wear. i would order another one again. really comfy plus pockets are awesome. its a nice summer dress.
3740,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Too short Product wqs too small on the torso.
3741,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Way Too BIG I'm 161 and 5'10&#34; and wear a medium so that's what I ordered in this midweight sweatshirt. It fits like an extra large with a gigantic waist. I washed and dried it on high but it didn't shrink. I guess Russell Athletic Wear assumes everyone's a lard ass.
3742,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Size up from the size you estimate from their measurement ... Size up from the  size you estimate from their measurement page.  This dress is not busty girl friendly.
3743,1,B07XD71F1H,0,It wasn’t cut properly super terrible skirt cut. It was cute but skirt part was messed up disappointing. :(
3744,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Not sized right. This fits huge in some areas and tight in others. Very cheap material.
3745,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,Clown outfit anyone? The polka dots we really large.
3746,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Long maxi dress - if you're 5'3"" It is shorter in the front than in the back. I'm 5'3&#34; so this dress works fine for me. I bought a medium. With a lot of maxi dresses I have to knot at the side or hem, but this one is floor length in the back and hits a couple inches above my ankle in front. But keep in mind that  if you're taller you may have a tea length dress rather than floor length. Also there is a seam down the front of the dress. With the large polka dot pattern it is very noticeable since the pattern doesn't line up. With all that being said, it's fine for the price. For me, for the price point, it will serve its purpose of a long flowing casual dress to wear on a hot day"

3751,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"2yr old put this together The patches on the sleeves looked terrible...threads sticking out in multiple places.  The pic is very flattering, however, the cardigan we received looked like a 2 yr old put it together.  Awful!"
3752,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Thread stitching not great Looks great, fits great, however, the quality is not the best. After washing it one time the threads starting to pull out and unravel. Other than that, good!"

3754,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Thin fabric & Poor Quality I was disappointed in this purchase. It is very thin fabric & seems low quality. I do like the colors, but I bought this to keep me warm in heavily air conditioned places & it just doesn’t work."
3755,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Poorly cut These are made from cheap “silky” material. The cut is small and awkward. I would not buy these again.
3756,2,B09M6X79V9,0,"I was most looking forward to the heathered grey tank ... I was most looking forward to the heathered grey tank. I did not even receive it in my package. It was just the black and white and they fit slightly smaller than expected. The stitching on the side was also not as expected. It the pictures, it appears to be a straight stitch down the side of the tanks, but the stitching on the ones I received curved in towards the front of the tank."

3760,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,Cute but cheaply made . ... The dress came in within expected dates. It's a super cute dress. The material is very light and see through. The length is shorter than expected. I was disappointed that the seam in the front is not well sowne. My friend bought one for less and it was in better condotion.
3761,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Great product Kinda small for the size order up one size

3768,3,B0B16Q1854,0,The item was what I expected The pants are very comfortable easy fit nice to wear in or out side.
3769,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Sheer These are very comfortable but I bought them to work out in and they are NOT squat proof at all. You can see my whole butt when I squat. They are really comfortable though so if you just want to wear them and don’t plan on squatting or bending over you’ll probably like them.
3770,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Awful Shirts are very small, I even went up a size. And they are not long by any means. I kept them just to clean around the house but I would not recommend especially if you are 5’8 or taller you may need to be 5’0 for the shirts to be long enough"
3771,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,must be Asian sizes and seams were crocked these must be Asian sizes.  It was way to small and the side seams were crocked.

3773,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Baggy leggings They were fine, maybe just not my style. It just looked and had the fabric of being loose leggings."
3774,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"because I liked the cut of the dress The pattern looked different to me in person - I thought the polka dots seemed much larger than the dress in the photo, which made it look kind of dumpy, which is a real shame, because I liked the cut of the dress."
3775,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Cheated Seller had a return option when I bought it and now that option is GONE!! Dress is see through and sized wrong or I was given the wrong size(I ordered the XL and it fits like maybe a largish medium!! I wish sellers would stop doing this to us!
3776,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Seams ripped out on first wash. Very disappointing. Seam ripped out after 1st washing.
3777,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,All 3 are different sizes The shirts are all sized slightly different  Smaller than expected.
3778,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Sizes run small Sizes run small
3779,2,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not my favorite I had really high expectations for these, and sadly am very disappointed. They give me MAJOR camel toe from the moment I put them on, and the ""compression"" is really only the top 5 inches, leaving my lower stomach sticking out (not flattering at all). Also the fabric is loose the around my lower calf for some reason. I could see these being nice if you're super toned, but it's a no from me."
3780,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Wrong sizes Love the shirts.... but very disappointed! I ordered a set of 3 (XL). I actually received only 1( XL) and 2 (3XX) that were huge. Looked like it had been opened and stuffed back into the package not folded. Very fishy!!!

3789,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Quality is not so good. I was hoped those are like 90 degrees but not so and I made got return to seller.
3790,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not what the product states It was not a compression shirt. It was too thin more of a fit dry shirt

3794,3,B097RFTKJP,0,"LOVED, but... I love the fit and style. Really gives the hour glass shape illusion. It didn't wash well. Fabric is already pilling and looks like it is covered in snags. I washed in a lingerie bag but it didn't help. I always wash new items in lingerie bags because the quality of the fabric is not always known at time of purchase."
3795,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,See through lovely house dress This is a cute dress and I have received compliments however it is very see through; which forces me to use it now as a house dress.

3801,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Not like the picture Not as advertised..... doesn’t look like the pic
3802,1,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Very disappointed. The siz says xl but in reality is made for someone who is a Medium size. Very disappointed.
3803,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,does not fit from size chart i didn't like how it fit and i went by your size chart and the neck was way to big. All of shirt was to big all over
3804,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Cheap material but affordable option It kind of reminds me of a sports Jersey material. Not that sweat absorbent but gets the job done. You get what you pay for.
3805,1,B009R09Z8W,0,Not the color showed in picture at all Ordered this to go with a pair of sneakers and it didn’t match the neon pink at all was more of a light pink
3806,3,B07XD71F1H,0,Very pretty colors but thin fabric Dress is advertised as a T Shirt Dresses Casual Swing Dress.  It was at least one size too small for the thin elastic fabric.  I ordered an XL as I wear the US size 14 fit but was still clingier than desired with the stretchy fabric
3807,2,B076QD9NP1,0,Better fabric needed Ripped on the collar already.

3817,1,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Black ones are no where near squat proof!!! Although they are super comfy they are very see throw. I am very upset because the description said they are mostly squat proof but they are in no way squat proof. I’m very upset with this purchase. I purchased another color just waiting on it to come in. I’ll update once they come in.
3818,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Not worth it Not compression...at all.
3819,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,Extremely thin material Shirt is paper thin. A few washes and this will fall apart - hence the price.
3820,2,B0928FSGGD,0,"RUN VERY SMALL I bought these twice in bigger sizes and still had to give the Large to my 12 year old (i'm 5'7'', 140 lb and usually wear a medium). They are decent shirts, just really small. And not just tight, they aren't stretchy enough to be comfortably tight. I gave two stars because the quality is decent but they just don't fit."
3821,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not hot pink I was so looking forward to finally finding a large hot pink sweatshirt and then it was delivered. So disappointed. It’s just a regular pink.
3822,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Don't buy tear apart after one time wear I was excited to buy these but after wearing one time and washing them they fell apart big holes under the arm.i have a brand new front loader washer and dryer so that's not the problem its the naterial.i am so disappointed to spend the money on these when I never got to wear but once. Don't waste your money on these
3823,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Ok It's fit good looks nice but when you start moving around it rolls up annoying I don't wear anymore
3824,1,B07S8KMCQW,0,Fits Small. I wanted to love this but it fits way to small.

3829,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"You get what you pay for Perfect example of getting what you pay for here. The shirts have actual tags on the backs of the neck! Who does that these days? These tags, are the MOST bothersome things you will experience in your day to day operations. Removing said tags, is IMPOSSIBLE to do without destroying the “integrity” of the shirt. The shirts are also unexpectedly short. I ordered a 3X. I don’t typically wear a 3X, but I wanted an undershirt that was tall enough to stay tucked in. These aren’t available in the tall variety, so I ordered a size too big. Can’t wait to trash the other 2 after I wear them once"
3830,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Did not compress It fits like a loose performance vest, I returned it."
3831,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Terrible The fleece sweater, after only 2 washings is already shedding and pilling.  Not happy with this product at all.  Will never buy this brand again."
3832,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,Good stretch in the legs but tight waist band. The waist band is very tight. I like the stretch in the legs  and how they fit but the waist band seems to be way tighter then it needs to be. I like how they stay up and in place when doing yoga. Love the pants just wish the waist wasn't so tight and restricting. For reference I am 139lbs and hold my weight in my hips got a size large.
3833,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Bummed Bought an XL. Great fit up top. A little droopy in cleavage of the shirt but waist area was way to wide. Returned got a large. Large fit like a training bra. Way to tight around every area. Works for some. Might just not be my type of shirt.

3840,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Not the color advertised I purchased this to wear while at a breast cancer walk. I wanted to make certain that I wasn’t to hot or too cold while walking. When it arrived I immediately noticed that it was not the color that was advertised. I picture shows a deep neon pink like a fuchsia. I received pink but not the one advertised.
3841,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression tops but decent. They're not compression tops at all but they're good for beating the heat in summer.
3842,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Got to stop buying shirts on Amazon Terrible. I thought the green would be a little darker. And I swear I ordered Large size ...the tags SHOW M FOR MEDIUM and the shirts do feel like a very tight medium

I got a 3 pack: the white fit well and the material was nicely slick, the blue one felt stretched out after one wearing, and the gray one fit in the chest but the torso was about 3 inches too short, so I could barely tuck it in.  Not happy with the value and inconsistent sizing."

3851,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Bait-N-Switch? I just received my order.  I ordered 2 full workout sweat suits; one black and one gray.  I was pleased with the shipping speed from time of order to delivery.  However I am not sure I received original RUSSELL sports wear.  My other RUSSELL gear is used daily and has lasted a long time.<br /><br />I have to say that what I just received feels like &#34;Chinese-knock offs.&#34;  The material is thin; the quality of sewing is terrible.  Basically I think Amazon did a spin on me; you know a &#34;bait-n-switch&#34; where you think you are buying quality products and get shipped seconds.  My entire $112 order for 2 pairs of sweats is just like this.

3856,3,B07XD71F1H,0,True to size but fabric is too thin. Fabric is too thin. The dress is see-through. It’s comfortable just as long as you were Cami underneath.
3857,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Flying squirrel The arms of this hoodie are super huge and baggy and it’s kinda short. One user said it was like a flying squirrel hoodie and I will have to agree with that user. Sent it back with no issues though so that was nice. For reference I’m 5’11 and 150 lbs and it was way too short. I think this hoodie would work well for someone 5’6 and shorter.
3858,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Nice feel The sleeves are not long enough buy a size up .. not good that you can’t choose your own colors all the colors are still mixed with the colors that you already had or would buy !! Will choose another seller for these reasons way too expensive!!
3859,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Read description carefully and always order bigger size Was not what I wanted. Was under women's wifebeaters which is what I wanted. Got exersice tops
3860,2,B09M6X79V9,0,These tops are nice but didnt receive 3 There was only 2 tank tops in package...supposed to be 3
3861,3,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Sizing - more TTS than the reviews say The suggestions in comments and the product tester encouraged to size down. I wish I wouldn't have done that, but otherwise they are super soft and comfy1"
3862,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Floppy arms The arms are huge and flowing but I still like it as the torso fits well. I'm a full XL but if I was thinner I would go a size down for sure.
3863,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Blah Not compression just plain old tank tops won't buy again
3864,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Super cute! Super cute cardigan!! Love the style! The material seems high quality, yet the first day I wore it, the hem was unraveling. Not the worst thing, but kind of a bummer."
3865,2,B097RFTKJP,0,beautiful dress until you wash it Already get rid of the dress the fabric got ugly after the first wash
3866,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,One Star very big for this shirt size
3867,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Size up! Very pretty, little small on top. Gave it to my neice. Looks great on her!"
3868,1,B097RFTKJP,0,"Thin material, cheaply made. The dress material was extremely thin and see threw , returned."
3869,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Three Stars Too big  !
3870,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Stained 4/9 white tank tops that I ordered were stained from the blue tank tops.
3871,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Sizing is super strange Update: 2 years later I thought I'd try again with Medium. Tag says medium but there's a small ""xs""I tag sewn underneath and they definitely fit like an XS. Frustrating! See pic.<br /><br />I ordered small originally, I'm a size 4 with no bum or thighs. They were at least 2 sizes too big, very baggy, had to use the drawstring - unflattering. So naturally, I sized down to the XS, which are made for a size 00. Couldn't get them over my (non-existent) hips. I don't know who was in charge of measuring these, but they should be fired. LOL."
3872,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,Super weird cut Super weird cut
3873,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Looks just like picture, but runs small I like the top but it runs small and I did not see that begore I bought it or I would have ordered a Large.  I never wear a large, usually a Medium or a Small.  The Medium fits like a small and the arm length just barely works.  I would have returned it, but I didnt see free returns so I'm just keeping it."
3874,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"There are better options for the price This sweatshirt makes that fuzzball appearance due to its high polyester concentration. Because this color is white, even the smallest amount of dirt that gets stuck in these fuzzballs show. I would prefer the champion eco fleece sweatshirt"
3875,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Shrank after a couple of washings. I am 5'8"" and 152, medium too small, would order one size larger. After washing fits too tight. Otherwise OK quality for the price. Good weight for cool spring temperatures."
3876,2,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Scratchy, See-Through, Nothing Special Wouldn't recommend this shirt.  It's just blah and the fabric feels gross while working out."
3877,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Too small at the chest Too small, the chest was tight... I returned it"
3878,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Too tight in the bust I really wanted to love this dress but there was absolutely no stretch in the bust. Fit great every where else but not for girls with even a slight bosom! In 36 D and 5'2""and ordered the large which was recommended size."
3879,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Not worth it About 3 sizes too small. Sleeves are long, but the material doesn't line up underneath arms. Not as long as what is pictured. Material is light and thin."
3880,3,B09MJ6NSNM,0,"Okay, but quality is questionable These workout shirts are just okay for the price, I guess.  I did notice that after the first wash, a couple of them showed signs of pilling.  Also, they don't breathe that well so if you do work up a sweat, it tends to stay on the shirts.  But just okay for the price."
3881,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Impracticably long and wide sleeves Ridiculously shaped. Torso slim and length short but sleeves impracticably long and wide. Won't purchase again, much prefer Champion or Hanes."
3882,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Yuck Was the cheapest material smelled like plastic
3883,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,Pilling = no thanks Too big and pilled like crazy almost immediately.
3884,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Cheap in a bad way Ripped after a few wears
3885,3,B0B16Q1854,0,Fit weird This pair fit very awkwardly. Someone was in a hurry to finish sewing. It feels as though the front and back pieces were reversed in the sewing process.
3886,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Love these tops! Well worth the money! Super comfy and cute! Perfect for cooler weather without overheating while working out!
3887,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression tank No compression at all. Good as a regular tank.
3888,2,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Cute, thin material, cheap construction Cute sweater. Color matched what was shown. Very thin material. Shoddy seam work. See pictures. The right shoulder seam had a 1 inch hole that was not sewn together. The right under arm seam had a glob of string hanging from it."
3889,2,B08F1V3KB9,0,"Order up 2 sizes I wanted these for lounge pants. So I ordered up one size, because let's face it clothes from Amazon usually run small. Should have ordered up two sizes."
3890,1,B0B16Q1854,0,Smaller then usual 3xl These definitely run smaller then usual. I wear a 3xl in sweat pants but I can't even get these 3xl on they are too small
3891,3,B09M6X79V9,0,... usually get and XL and they fit me more like a medium or large They were to small for me and I usually get and XL and they fit me more like a medium or large.
3892,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Ordered for my size Did not get the compression I expected
3893,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Don’t buy this! It’s an awful dress. Too small, too short (and I’m only 5ft 3” but it came up to mid calf) and definitely looks like a different pattern to the photo - the white dots are much bigger in person and it overpowers the dress. Looked like a clown! Sent back immediately."
3894,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Ok... runs small Very cute - color was a little more dull in person than in the picture. Also fit a little small. The sleeves were too short and it was awkwardly short in the back - I realize that's the style of the sweater, where it drapes longer in the front, but the back went up higher than I prefer with that style. I sent it back for a size up. I'm 5'9&#34;, athletic build and usually wear a M so I would get it in a L."
3895,3,B09M6X79V9,0,I need 4x My shirts I order they r to small and they say 3x but I should of got 4x but it will just keep them I didn't like these tank tops so I didn't know they were so spandex tight on me so I am not wearing them
3896,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"love the dress but poorly made or mine was super ... I wore this twice and then went to was it and the strap ripped right in half, it was on the gentle delicate cycle, love the dress but poorly made or mine was super faulty. I bought it in February waiting for spring summer but now I have to try and fix it or buy again. Be super careful upon washing."
3897,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,you definitely have order at least two sizes larger I ... you definitely have order at least two sizes larger I  normally wear an XL and this fabric doesn't flex much so it fits a little snug.
3898,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"it's a fine sweatshirt especially for ten bucks Very well made, but the size was a bit too big on me. More specifically, the shoulder seem was a bit too far down the sleeve. Then again, I'm picky about that kind of stuff. Otherwise, it's a fine sweatshirt especially for ten bucks."
3899,3,B09M6X79V9,0,... always pull up when I’m wearing them which is annoying and they don’t really compress anything Mine always pull up when I’m wearing them which is annoying and they don’t really compress anything...
3900,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not bad for the price though These are ok.  I found them to be a bit short for being 6'2'' and they rode up when active.  Not bad for the price though.
3901,3,B09M6X79V9,0,doesn't feel like compression tank tops doesn't feel like compression tank tops. pretty much regular tank tops that are soft. dont fit the way i thought they would for the price.
3902,2,B09MJ6NSNM,0,Ok The shirt was tailored at the bottom
3903,2,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,"It was what I order but it was a white small substance on it Right color and right size, but it was some white stuff on lower bottom that wouldn’t come off but it feel like doing through the hassle of mailing it back"
3904,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Not a nice workout fabric. Felt heavy and cheap
3905,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"You Never Know What You're Getting The mens hoodie I ordered came with no tags on it, hair was on it that was not mine, smelled like perfume, and in the pocket was half a used infant sock?<br />Most likely a return sent to me.<br />You Never Know What You're Getting!"
3906,1,B097RFTKJP,0,Wrong size. This is a small ordered a large.
3907,2,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not for curvy shapes Cute design, but only for people who have a more straight shape. Too small in the chest and butt, too big in the tummy and calves. NO stretch, and mediocre fabric quality. Not worth the price, but I needed something fast and had to wear it."
3908,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"If you're above 5'6"" this will be too short If you're above 5'6"" this will be too short"
3909,3,B0928FSGGD,0,Size up Go a size up! They run small
3910,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Poor quality These items were a complete waste of money. I ordered them to layer under my work uniform. The first day I wore one, it was frayed and practically shredded around the neck and arms. The seams came undone and it was practically falling apart. Do not recommend."
3911,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"Not for us busty gals... The dress is very nice to look at and mostly comfortable.  It fit everywhere except for the chest.  I wear a 40 DD and this felt like a sports bra up top.  There was no room whatsoever.  I hated to return the dress, but it just wouldn't work for me."
3912,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,I like them but…. Material is great. Colors are great. My only complaint is they run a little small.
3913,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Loved it until I washed them It was a perfect and comfortable fit before I washed and dried it. The length is so short now that I'm uncomfortable in them, and SO many pills. Pretty disappointing. I've had Russell sweaters for years and this is the first time I've experienced them shrinking and pilling so bad. Waste of 40 dollars."
3914,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Unsatisfactory Not a good product
3915,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"I wear a 38B bra so I had to add a dart to the breast of the dress to get a perfect fit. As for the color and design of ... The bust of the size dress I chose was too large, however waist down was -perfect. I wear a 38B bra so I had to add a dart to the breast of the dress to get a perfect fit. As for the color and design of the dress you could not ask for anything better."
3916,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Scratchy, Runs Small, Color Not As Expected I fell in love with the color on the ad. However, when the pants arrived I was disappointed to say the least. The color is dull, ok I guess I could live with that, but the worst part is the fabric is not at all soft as you'd expect from a pair of sweatpants. I'd have been better off buying a pair of Hanes from WalMart. Basically you're paying for the brand name. But the quality is subpar."
3917,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Wouldn’t recommend The fit is horrible. There’s not enough length in the crotch area. Therefore, the pants just fall down in the back."
3918,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Would not recommend Pockets were sewn half way shut.  Had to rip out the stitching. They had black smears on them, like the got stuck in a pully, or rollers . One side seem opened after one wash . Not well constructed."
3919,3,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Neon Pink Neon Pink…not fuchsia pink. I’ll still keep it but picture is not accurate.
3920,2,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Disappointed I ordered this first in a medium for my husband, based on the reviews.  He is not a large man but likes to have room in his sweatshirts to wear a shirt underneath it. The medium was just a little too small, not the huge size as suggested by the reviews.  So, I sent it back and ordered the large, which is the size my husband usually wears.  The large came in and the neck opening is huge while the rest of the sweatshirt is fine.  I ended up sending this sweatshirt back.  I will have to buy a different brand and try my luck there.  Very disappointing as the price was good and service was great both returning and sending out new ones.  I had ordered red and black and both were sent back.  Would not recommend buying."
3921,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,Like it but just to small I like the material but it's to small doesn't fit
3922,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Not made to stop belly from moving around Not thick or strong enough to hold belly still.
3923,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,s It's a bit bigger than expected. It'll be ok with a shirt under it which is how I'll wear it. Otherwise I'm happy with it.
3924,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Thin like a shirt. cardigans are made of sweater material the ad was very misleading Material is thin like a shirt. It’s listed as a cardigan but it’s really a thin long sleeved shirt. Not very warm.
3925,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Wish to return Not what they look like at all
3926,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Not compression tanks Definitely not compression wear.
3927,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,"Not Compression at All Just got these and tried them on. If you're looking for compression, this isn't it. It only lays on your skin flat and that's about it. It doesn't taper your chest in nor feel tight around certain spots. It's just regular under clothing vest."
3928,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Very very small sizing Well the shirts were super  Is cute however their 3 acts is probably for a child my mom wears a size small and they were too tight for her us large women should not buy these.
3929,3,B07XD71F1H,0,"Order your actually size. Love thr color just order your size I am 5""7 170LBS  I ordered a 2xl thinking it would run small like the other  items. It's way to big."
3930,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Very nice but large I have always loves these simple crew neck sweaters. Instant classic. One word of warning - I'm 6' 180 lbs with a 40 tall jacket and I'm absolutely swimming the large size I bought.<br /><br />Will buy again but ill go for a medium next time.
3931,3,B0B16Q1854,0,"Disappointed I ordered 3 pairs of these in different colors, 2 of them had pockets and 1 didn't, also 1 pair fit a little weird, like I had them on backwards!<br /> I loved how they looked when they arrived, they were comfortable, but running a little small.<br />The disappointing part is after 1 wash all 3 came out peely, little balls all over the pant, and got worse after each wash<br />So....they are cute but look like I've had them for years,<br /> and they are only a month old."
3932,2,B0928FSGGD,0,Inaccurate sizing Nice warm shirts.  I was afraid they would be too big because I odered a size up.  They are TOO small.  I gave them to my daughter who wears a size 14 girls.  These shirt are womens 8-10 and fit her perfectly.
3933,3,B09H6MXJ71,0,Good buy just get the next size up Great buy BUT if you wear a Large t-Shirt but the XL tank . Large is too tight
3934,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Two Stars The white shirt had two stains on it.
3935,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Dont Buy This item does not fit nor look the way the model is wearing it.😠😠😠
3936,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Nice purchase The fit was okay. Doesn't have the same compression as others I've purchased from this seller. Overall pleased.
3937,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Good But Not Enough Length. Not enough length. I order the 3X and it was still to short. I love everything else about it though.
3938,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Love the dry fit shirts but they are not true to size I loved them but they are not true to size. Order a size up. I returned them.
3939,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Itchy and very very cheap material This tank top feels like the cheapest material you could imagine. Like polyester mixed with single ply toilet paper you'd find in the 98 cent store. Itches my skin, ran them through the washer to see if that'd help, but it didn't.<br /><br />Uncomfortably tight around the shoulders and upper back, very loose on the chest.<br /><br />I can confidently say this is the worst tank top I've ever tried in my life."
3940,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Runs small. Beautiful but runs very small. I returned it for a refund.
3941,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,get a size smaller than you are for a tight fit these are super soft and comfy but the sizes run large even if you measure your chest and torso to the chart... get a smaller size than you measure. mine are very loose im hoping they shrink in the wash.
3942,1,B07XD71F1H,0,Poor quality material. Poor quality material. The dress was clingy in a bad way and see through.
3943,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Three Stars Fits just fine except for the length.
3944,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,"Not happy at all The product is very uncomfortable, the material is rough and feels like Im wearing a sports bra.  I dont like them at all."
3945,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,Hot pink color is not as pictured The pink i received is nothing like what was pictured. I received some bubble gum neon pink ugliness. Not the saturated deep pink that the model in the image is wearing.
3946,1,B07XD71F1H,0,"very thin, see through material, not as advertised or as selfie pictured- very thin material, didn't even try it on, very expensive- quality really should have cost $5.00- I<br />did a return to Kohl's the very next day and still haven't recieved my refund but by now the company has both their flimsy nightgown dress/long see through shirt and my $28.99  plus tax- Please refund my money, you have your product"
3947,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,Falling apart already Only washed twice and the hood is already coming undone from the neck of the jacket. I have previously purchased russel athletic sweatshirts before. Horribly dissatisfied with this quality control. Will update review when exchange is processed.
3948,2,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,Not loose I like my shirts loose. These will not be loose-fitting. Unless you size up very high.
3949,3,B07CQ84KLT,0,"The dress is really cute... but when ... The dress is really cute...but when I put it on, my boobs were smooshed...but the rest of the dress was comfy."
3950,1,B084LJ5ZJ5,0,The color was orange pink Very disappointed.  The color wasn't near the color advertised.
3951,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Not the greatest quality Stitching came undone after only a few wears
3952,1,B07XD71F1H,0,To large To large & to frumpy no good.
3953,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Did not like material Did not like material
3954,2,B07XD71F1H,0,Fabric poor quality After one wear and wash in cold water the fabric was faded and fuzzy.
3955,3,B009R09Z8W,0,"Not what I wanted I orded a 4X in blue (I like it oversized) and I got a XL in green - still fits, but I wish I got the right thing that I ordered."
3956,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,I wanted an athletic fit with a small neck like the picture shows I wanted an athletic fit with a small neck like the picture shows.  It isn't even close.  I bought a large and it is more like an XXL for a fat grizzly bear.  Large neck opening and very large around the waste.  Don't waste your money unless you are a grizzly bear.
3957,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Not exactly a compression tank I was hoping for a compression tank but these went it. They feel amazing but they do not stay in place& pull up constantly. They don't ""compress"" much. I'm keeping them because they're nice under tee but weren't what i wanted."
3958,2,B09H6MXJ71,0,Too small Too small actually!
3959,3,B07BM9GWG7,0,Short length. Quality is decent. Price is good. But 2 of the three are very short in length.
3960,1,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Did not like it I cannot get the wrinkles out
3961,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,I specifically ordered a size bigger than I usually do ... I specifically ordered a size bigger than I usually do so it would be loose.  It was still too tight.
3962,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Good sizes Nice color
3963,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,More like a silky tang top These are not compression shirts. More like a silky tang top.
3964,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Disappointed The pants are beautiful and comfortable. I loved the huge lettering on the side and the huge us polo design, but when received they seemed used. They are very frayed in the crotch area."
3965,1,B009R09Z8W,0,"Very Disappointed. I returned this item because the arms were too short for a 3XL.  My boyfriend is 6'5"" and he would have looked like a baby huey in that hoodie.  The material was very thin and once again did not match the description.,"
3966,1,B09H6MXJ71,0,Not as advertised This is mesh but was described as Sri fit type.
3967,3,B009R09Z8W,0,Not heavy enough for winter cold They are great for spring and fall but I don't think they will be very warm this winter. they are nicely made just not heavy enough for me.
3968,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Returned it Returned for a bigger size and after receiving the Med I could have used a L.<br />I am 5’3 and weigh 128. It’s tight in the stomach. I hope yours is flat lol
3969,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,"Cute cardigan... order up Cute cardigan overall but not as long as it appears in the picture. Definitely order up, especially if you have bigger arms like me."
3970,2,B07BM9GWG7,0,WAY TO SHORT Low stars because the shirts are VERY short. These are the first compression shirts I have ever purchased that aren't able to be tucked in (which is the point) I wear compression shirts to the gym and having them roll up is a real pain in the ass. Unfortunately I won't be able to wear these. I'm 6'2&#34; tall and the the 2XL are cut for someone who's 5'6&#34; or so.
3971,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Sweatshirt runs bigger than expected. The sweatshirt was bigger than expected and the drawstrings are like 4 inches too long . It’s ok !
3972,3,B07XD71F1H,0,material material is too thin
3973,1,B09M6X79V9,0,One Star Bought these tanks to work out. I couldn't use them because they were just too thin.
3974,1,B09M6X79V9,0,Don’t fit They didn’t fit
3975,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Good Good
3976,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"Expected compression. All it is is a nice quality tank top. Runs bigger no compression at all. Nice quality material. Was hoping from some compression so I did not have to wear a sport bra under it, but no such luck. Runs big. Ordered a medium should have ordered an extra small to get any compression or support."
3977,3,B09M6X79V9,0,Great fit Love the extra length of these tanks.  Received lots of compliments especial on the vibrant colors. Will probably buy more as you can never have enough.
3978,3,B09M6X79V9,0,rides up These tops look great and are comfortable but when I run I find myself pulling my top down. It defeats the purpose of a work out top. I gave 3 stars because they really do look great and I ordered and extra large and I liked how it went below my waist and the material seemed to absorb the perspiration. I am 5'1 and weigh 187 lbs.
3979,1,B09M6X79V9,0,"Cheap quality material and short length Very cheap material, too cheap to be moisture wicking. Very short length."
3980,2,B097RFTKJP,0,Weird dress I wanted to like this but just wasn’t for me
3981,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,"One Star ordered in my size, but still too small"
3982,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Fit as expected But not as I expected..
3983,2,B0B16Q1854,0,"Sizing is not the same. I was not pleased with this purchase. I bought the same pair, in the same size in blue and they fit perfectly. I love that pair. The grey ones are to tight and they have already started to come apart. Definitely disappointed. Sizing should fit the same."
3984,1,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Do Not Waste Your Money! I admit that when you only pay $25.00 for a sweatshirt you probably shouldn't expect much, but when I tried one of the two sweatshirts I ordered it fit great.  Then I washed them.  The lining disintegrated.  It ended up as lint in the dryer and what was left on the sweatshirt were lint balls on both the interior and exterior.  I think if I washed them a second time I would have a &#34;tee-shirt&#34; weight hoodie.  I repeat: Do Not Waste Your Money."
3985,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"VERY warm I bought these shirts expecting them to be a dryfit fabric that keeps you warm when you're cold and cold when you're warm, but these shirts just retain all of your heat no matter what. There were times where I was completely drenched in sweat just walking around the airport from the shear heat that these retain. If you're going out in the winter when it's below 30 degrees F they would be great, but I was wearing them in 40 degree weather and it was still way too warm for me."
3986,3,B01JUP0DLQ,0,Didn't fit as expected The material is very thin and the sweater did not fall right. Expected it to be longer in the front
3987,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,Three Stars adhesive on labels will not come off. would order more if not for that
3988,2,B09M6X79V9,0,Decent Product Product fits well. One ripped at the Seams after first wash…
3989,1,B07BM9GWG7,0,"IS JUST LIKE WEARING REGULAR T FABRIC TOO SOFT, IS JUST LIKE WEARING REGULAR T SHIRT"
3990,3,B0B2KL8C8Q,0,"Work shirts These shirts will wprk for what I bought them, which is just to have another layer on under my work uniform. They are comfortable and warm without being too warm. The only thing that I dont like is the length of the torso on the shirt. It tends to ride up and doesn't want to stay down. I've had to stretch it out so it'll stay. But otherwise, not a bad but."
3991,1,B08F1V3KB9,0,Made in China Did not like fabric. Item cheaply constructed. Made in China.
3992,1,B07CQ84KLT,0,One Star Doesn't look like the picture at all
3993,3,B09M6X79V9,0,"buy smaller than size chart recommends I bought the size suggested, I should have gone a size smaller and then maybe it would be compression. The size the product suggests is not just a under tank."
3994,3,B0928FSGGD,0,"Snug! The shirts are a nice quality, but they’re super snug. I normally wear a small in everything, but I don’t like my workout tops to cling to me so I ordered a medium. The medium fit like a small and clung to me revealing all muffin tops and bra lines pants lines and even my underwear line under my pants. I’m 5’2 and 120 pounds so I’m not exactly overweight. But this shirt  some how managed to enhance my gut. I should have gotten a large but I figure it’s good motivation to try to lose the gut."
3995,3,B07S8KMCQW,0,"Fit is way smaller than most sizing (Zella, Lululemon, Nike, etc). Sizing is way off. I am always a small in workout shirt and this was way too tight and super tight at the bottom of the shirt. Odd and uncomfortable"
3996,1,B0B16Q1854,0,"Not true to size Runs small, disapointed."
3997,3,B09KHSM7BB,0,"Room to grow Large is apparently in the eye of the manufacturer and the buyer.  I should have ordered a medium which didn't seem much smaller from their size chart.  Sleeves and chest are oversize for me, but the garment seems well made, and I'll keep it."
3998,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Seamless looks bad in the bum I like the color, fabric, fit, etc. But I didn’t realize there was no seam in the back. That gives no definition in the bum:("
3999,3,B0BVMLJTFS,0,"Not sweat proof Great material and very comfortable, however, they aren’t sweat proof as seen here in the photo."
